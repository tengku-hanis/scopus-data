Scientists are currently testing several drugs to eradicate the COVID-19 outbreak. However, there is no 100 % effective drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered so far. In this study, we explored the structure prediction and functional analysis of 75 Malaysia SARS-CoV-2 strain’s structural and accessory proteins without the presence of experimental models. Physiochemical analysis, secondary structure analysis, structure prediction, functional characterization, active site identification, and evolutionary analysis based on the amino acid sequences retrieved from National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Three-dimensional (3-D) protein structures were built using the Swiss model. The quality of protein models was verified by ERRAT, PROCHECK, and Verify 3D tools. Active prediction analysis revealed the high potential active sites of proteins where the anti-viral drug or vaccine may bind and inhibit the viral activities. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of ORF10, ORF8, and ORF6 proteins from five different species was analyzed. The results from this analysis proved that Homo sapiens SARS-CoV-2 had high genetic similarity with the bat coronavirus. These analyses may help in designing structure-based antiviral drugs or to develop potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. © 2021 by the authors.","Evolutionary analysis; Malaysia; SARS-CoV-2; Sequence analysis; Structure prediction",

"Proposal for development of a guideline in maintaining quality cancer care during and post-covid-19 in an upper middle-income country with universal health coverage",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114044152&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcpo.2021.100300&partnerID=40&md5=fe2dc910fd553aa1f340abb36b0968ea","Background: During periods of high community transmission of COVID-19, the public hospitals in Malaysia, an upper middle-income country, have been forced to scale down elective surgeries, prioritize cancer treatments based on treatment benefits, and postpone non-emergency imaging procedures. These inevitably led to disruptions in cancer care delivery within the public health care system. This study aims to explore the facilitators and barriers faced by healthcare providers and cancer survivors in cancer care, and to co-design a guideline to maintain the delivery of cancer care amid the disaster situations. Method: In-depth interviews (IDIs) will be conducted with Malaysian healthcare providers and cancer survivors and findings will be analysed thematically. The insights will be used in a subsequent phase to co-design a guideline to maintain the delivery of quality cancer care in Malaysia via a three-round modified Delphi survey with a broad range of cancer stakeholders. Expected results: Findings derived from IDIs and existing literature will be included for rating across three rounds by the expert panel. Feedback provided will be refined until consensus on the best practises for cancer care continuity during crises is achieved. Conclusion: The output of the present study is not only expected to ensure the continuity of delivery of high-quality cancer care in Malaysia during the ongoing pandemic but also to be adapted during unforeseen crises in the near future. Policy summary statement: Collaborative work between policy makers, public health physicians, members of the multidisciplinary oncology team as well as cancer survivors is vital in developing an evidenced- based contingency plan for maintaining access to cancer care. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer care; COVID-19; Guideline; Upper middle-income country",

With its rapid spread and increasing numbers, it is becoming overwhelming for the healthcare workers to rapidly diagnose the condition and contain it from spreading. Hence it has become a necessity to automate the diagnostic procedure. This will improve the work efficiency as well as keep the healthcare workers safe from getting exposed to the virus. Medical image analysis is one of the rising research areas that can tackle this issue with higher accuracy. This paper conducts a comparative study of the use of the recent deep learning models (VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, Inception-ResNet-V2, InceptionV3, Resnet50, and Xception) to deal with the detection and classification of coronavirus pneumonia from pneumonia cases. This study uses 7165 chest X-ray images of COVID-19 (1536) and pneumonia (5629) patients. Confusion metrics and performance metrics were used to analyze each model. Results show DenseNet121 (99.48% of accuracy) showed better performance when compared with the other models in this study. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial neural networks; Classification; COVID-19; Deep learning; DenseNet121; Multi-task learning; Transfer learning","Deep learning; Health care; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Viruses; Chest X-ray image; Comparative studies; Diagnostic procedure; Healthcare workers; Multiple neural networks; Performance metrics; Viral infections; Work efficiency; Diagnosis"
"Needs, gaps and opportunities for standard and e-mental health care among at-risk populations in the Asia Pacific in the context of COVID-19: a rapid scoping review",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110791804&doi=10.1186%2fs12939-021-01484-5&partnerID=40&md5=855764fa95c9ff61a4c1d54d8bb2ec1c","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have profound mental health impact, including in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) region. Some populations might be at higher risk of experiencing negative mental health impacts and may encounter increased barriers to accessing mental health care. The pandemic and related restrictions have led to changes in care delivery, including a rapid shift to the use of e-mental health and digital technologies. It is therefore essential to consider needs and opportunities for equitable mental health care delivery to the most at-risk populations. This rapid scoping review: 1) identifies populations in the APEC region that are at higher risk of the negative mental health impacts of COVID-19, 2) identifies needs and gaps in access to standard and e-mental health care among these populations, and 3) explores the potential of e-mental health to address these needs. Methods: We conducted a rapid scoping review following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We searched Medline, Embase and PsychInfo databases and Google Scholar using a search strategy developed in consultation with a biomedical librarian. We included records related to mental health or psychosocial risk factors and COVID-19 among at-risk groups; that referred to one or more APEC member economies or had a global, thus generalizable, scope; English language papers, and papers with full text available. Results: A total of 132 records published between December 2019 and August 2020 were included in the final analysis. Several priority at-risk populations, risk factors, challenges and recommendations for standard and e-mental health care were identified. Results demonstrate that e-mental health care can be a viable option for care delivery but that specific accessibility and acceptability considerations must be considered. Options for in-person, hybrid or “low-tech” care must also remain available. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for equitable standard and e-mental health care. It has also highlighted the persistent social and structural inequities that contribute to poor mental health. The APEC region is vast and diverse; findings from the region can guide policy and practice in the delivery of equitable mental health care in the region and beyond. © 2021, The Author(s).","Asia Pacific; At-risk populations; COVID-19; E-mental health; Equity; Mental health","COVID-19; detection method; environmental history; health care; health impact; health insurance; health risk; mental health; risk factor; spatiotemporal analysis; age; AIDS patient; Asia; Black person; coronavirus disease 2019; disabled person; domestic violence; drug dependence; economic aspect; health care access; health care delivery; health care need; health care personnel; health care quality; health equity; high risk population; homelessness; human; indigenous people; juvenile; mental disease; mental health; mental health care; migrant; neurologic disease; pandemic; partner violence; practice gap; pregnancy; prisoner; psychosocial care; puerperium; refugee; Review; risk factor; social acceptance; telehealth; health service; mental disease; Pacific islands; pandemic; psychology; telemedicine; Pacific Rim; Asia; COVID-19; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Mental Disorders; Pacific Islands; Pandemics; Risk Factors; Telemedicine"

Here, we examined associations between COVID-19-related stress and body image disturbance, as well as the potential mediating and moderating role of self-compassion. During the third lockdown in the United Kingdom, we asked an online sample of adults (N = 600) to complete measures of COVID-19-related stress, body image disturbance, and self-compassion. Mediation analysis showed that higher COVID-19-related stress was significantly associated with greater body image disturbance, and that this relationship was mediated by self-compassion. In contrast, self-compassion did not significantly moderate the effects of stress on body image disturbance. These results suggest that promoting greater self-compassion may be a viable means of mitigating adverse outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic on body image disturbance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Body image disturbance; COVID-19; Lockdown; Self-compassion; Stress",

Although potential vaccines are being tested and supplied around the world, it will take a long time to reach every human being, more so with new variants of the virus emerging, enforcing a lockdown-like situation on parts of the world. Thus, there is a dire need for early and accurate detection of COVID-19 to prevent the spread of the disease, even more. The current gold-standard RT-PCR test is only 71% sensitive and is a laborious test to perform, leading to the incapability of conducting the population-wide screening. To this end, in this paper, we propose an automated COVID-19 detection system that uses CT-scan images of the lungs for classifying the same into COVID and Non-COVID cases. The proposed method applies an ensemble strategy that generates fuzzy ranks of the base classification models using the Gompertz function and fuses the decision scores of the base models adaptively to make the final predictions on the test cases. Three transfer learning-based convolutional neural network models are used, namely VGG-11, Wide ResNet-50-2, and Inception v3, to generate the decision scores to be fused by the proposed ensemble model. The framework has been evaluated on two publicly available chest CT scan datasets achieving state-of-the-art performance, justifying the reliability of the model.

Using Wavelet coherence analysis and spillover index methodologies in bivariate and multivariate settings, this study examines the correlation of these assets for different investment horizons. The findings suggest that gold, oil and Bitcoin exhibited low coherency with each stock index across almost all considered investment horizons until the onset of the COVID-19. Conversely, with the outbreak of the pandemic, the return spillover is more intense across financial assets, and a significant pairwise return connectedness between each equity index and hedging asset is observed. Hence, gold, oil, and Bitcoin do not exhibit safe-haven characteristics. However, by decomposing the time-varying co-movements into different investment horizons, we find that total and pairwise connectedness among the assets are primarily driven by a higher-frequency band (up to 4 days). It indicates that investors have diversification opportunities with gold, oil, and Bitcoin at longer horizons. The results are robust over different types of equity investors (traditional, sustainable, and Islamic) and various investment horizons. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bitcoin; Commodities; COVID-19; Equities; Gold; Interconnectedness; Investment portfolio; Oil; Pandemic; Spillover",
"Impacts of COVID-19 and social isolation on academic staff and students at universities: a cross-sectional study",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108830223&doi=10.1186%2fs12889-021-11040-z&partnerID=40&md5=f328b071c5ff94c096cca3108837f855","Background: “The impacts of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the shutdown it triggered at universities across the world, led to a great degree of social isolation among university staff and students. The aim of this study was to identify the perceived consequences of this on staff and their work and on students and their studies at universities. Method: The study used a variety of methods, which involved an on-line survey on the influences of social isolation using a non-probability sampling. More specifically, two techniques were used, namely a convenience sampling (i.e. involving members of the academic community, which are easy to reach by the study team), supported by a snow ball sampling (recruiting respondents among acquaintances of the participants). A total of 711 questionnaires from 41 countries were received. Descriptive statistics were deployed to analyse trends and to identify socio-demographic differences. Inferential statistics were used to assess significant differences among the geographical regions, work areas and other socio-demographic factors related to impacts of social isolation of university staff and students. Results: The study reveals that 90% of the respondents have been affected by the shutdown and unable to perform normal work or studies at their institution for between 1 week to 2 months. While 70% of the respondents perceive negative impacts of COVID 19 on their work or studies, more than 60% of them value the additional time that they have had indoors with families and others. Conclusions: While the majority of the respondents agree that they suffered from the lack of social interaction and communication during the social distancing/isolation, there were significant differences in the reactions to the lockdowns between academic staff and students. There are also differences in the degree of influence of some of the problems, when compared across geographical regions. In addition to policy actions that may be deployed, further research on innovative methods of teaching and communication with students is needed in order to allow staff and students to better cope with social isolation in cases of new or recurring pandemics. © 2021, The Author(s).","Academic staff; COVID-19; Social isolation; Students; University","communicable disease control; cross-sectional study; human; questionnaire; social isolation; student; university; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Social Isolation; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities"

Main body: In light of the higher vulnerability of men to COVID-19 than women, there is rising concerns on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male fertility and possibilities of seminal contamination and transmission. The pandemic has attributed to the brief suspension of many fertility clinics and pathology laboratories, though many remained functional. Few reports reflect that SARS-CoV-2 can contaminate the semen of COVID-19 patients as well as that of recovering patients. The viral invasion into the testis may be due to the disrupted anatomical barriers of the testis by the inflammatory responses, and the persistence of the virus in the semen may be facilitated by the testicular immune privilege. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus, it is also theoretically possible that this virus can remain viable in the semen samples even after cryopreservation with liquid nitrogen. Conclusion: The present review emphasizes the possibilities of seminal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby the chances of its sexual transmission. These perceptions and predictions are to facilitate immediate necessary actions to improvise the standard precautionary procedures for laboratory practices, including semen analysis or processing the semen sample for fertility treatments. © 2021, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Male infertility; SARS-CoV-2; Semen infection; Sexual transmission","liquid nitrogen; contamination; coronavirus disease 2019; cryopreservation; disease transmission; fertility clinic; human; immune privilege; infertility therapy; inflammation; male fertility; male infertility; pandemic; perception; persistent virus infection; prediction; Review; semen analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sexual transmission; testis; viral contamination; virus transmission"

However, addressing concerns among vaccine-hesitant individuals is essential to avoid failure of the immunisation programme. This study sought to assess the concerns and acceptance rates regarding the COVID-19 vaccine among Malaysians. Methods: An online questionnaire was distributed to 1411 respondents via a snowball sampling method among Malaysians aged 18 years and above. Results: The majority of the respondents were young adults (40.7%), female (62.8%), Malay (63.8%), Muslim (72.3%), married (52.9%), with tertiary education (86.8%) and without medical illness (85%). Social media (97.4%) was the primary source of information regarding COVID-19. The overall acceptance rate was high (83.3%), with the lowest rates among the elderly aged 60 years and above (63.4%) and pensioners (64.6%). Hesitance was caused by concerns regarding side effects (95.8%), safety (84.7%), lack of information (80.9%), effectiveness (63.6%) and religious (20.8%) and cultural factors related to the COVID-19 vaccine (6.8%). Respondents with diabetes mellitus (24.7%) and hypercholesterolemia (23%) were more hesitant to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, at 16.1 and 15.8%, respectively. Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance were age, religion, and current residence. Conclusions: The results indicate a high rate of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among Malaysians. Thus, the Malaysian government and other related agencies should increase their campaign and prepare to implement the COVID-19 mass immunisation programme among Malaysians. However, despite the high acceptance rate, it remains important to address concerns among hesitant individuals by building trust in vaccine safety and effectiveness through adequate information regarding the vaccine. © 2021, The Author(s).","Acceptance; Concern; COVID-19; Vaccine","vaccine; aged; cross-sectional study; female; human; questionnaire; vaccination; young adult; Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination; Vaccines; Young Adult"

It has become more critical during the COVID-19 pandemic than ever before. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, practices of hand hygiene among final-year medical students. It also explored reported hand hygiene behavior before the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for educational strategies to correct the deficiencies. Methods: A concurrent mixed-method approach was used. In the quantitative strand, a cross-sectional online survey was carried out via a Google form. Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-squared test were used for comparisons. In the qualitative strand, twelve participants were interviewed, based on a semi-structured interview guide and audio recorded. Transcribed data were evaluated with thematic content analysis. Results: A total of 225 final-year medical students were studied in the quantitative strand. Most were females. The mean score for knowledge was 3.35 ± 0.795 out of six. Of them, 31.6 % of participants scored below 3 points (< 50 % of the total). Most (78.9 %) had positive attitudes (score of > 80 %). Only 36.4 % reported “adequate” hand hygiene performance in all eight dimensions of the behavior domain. Noticeably, fewer participants reported to clean their hands after checking blood pressure (55.6 %), and only 66.2 % stated carrying a hand sanitizer in their pocket. Significant correlations were not found between reported behavior and attitudes (p = 0.821) or knowledge (p = 0.794). The qualitative strand with 12 respondents revealed the positive influence of both hierarchical and non-hierarchal role models. Time constraints, skin irritation, and workload pressures were the main barriers. Frequent reminders, supervision, and interactive teaching were suggested as methods to improve hand hygiene compliance. They also stated that increased enthusiasm was noted on hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. Conclusions: Most of the participants had positive attitudes towards hand hygiene. Yet, a considerable gap between attitudes and knowledge and reported hand hygiene behavior was evident. Coupling educational programs that use cognitive and behavioral methods, including role modeling, supervision, and frequent reminders, is recommended to bridge the knowledge-attitude-behavior gap. © 2021, The Author(s).","Attitude; Behavior; Hand Hygiene; Knowledge; Medical; Pandemics; Sri Lanka; Students","attitude to health; cross-sectional study; female; hand washing; human; male; medical student; pandemic; questionnaire; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hand Hygiene; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires"

This article aims to explore the discursive and linguistic means by which the COVID-19 pandemic, as a macro-event, has been translated into local micro-events. The analysis studies the global pandemic through the initial statements of 29 leading political actors across four continents. The aim is to examine discursive constructions of solidarity and nationalism through the social representation of inclusion/exclusion of in-, out-, and affiliated groups. The comparative analysis is based on the theoretical and methodological framework of the socio-cognitive approach to critical discourse analysis and is informed by argumentation theory and nationalism studies. The results of our analysis suggest that leaders have constructed the virus as the main outgroup through the metaphors of the pandemic-as-war and the pandemic-as-movement which have entered the national space. Faced with this threat, these speeches have discursively constructed the nation-as-a-team as the main in-group and prioritized (1) a vertical type of solidarity based on nationhood and according to governmental plans; (2) exclusionary solidarity against rule-breakers; (3) horizontal solidarity that is both intergenerational and among family members, and (4) transnational solidarity. It is not by chance that the world stands as a relevant affiliated group that needs to forcibly collaborate in order to face the main outgroup, the virus itself. A major consensus has been found in constructing the out-group. In contrast, the linguistic and discursive constructions of in-groups and their affiliates display a greater variation, depending upon the prevalent discursive practices and social context within different countries. © 2021, The Author(s).",,

Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2020. The outcomes were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale–21, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory, and World Health Organisation Quality of Life–BREF Scale (WHOQOL-BREF) in both English and validated Malay versions. Results: Mild-to-severe depression was found in 28.2% (n = 149) of the 528 respondents. Respondents with mild-to-severe depression were significantly younger (33.09 ± 10.08 versus 36.79 ± 12.47 years), without partner (71.8% versus 45.6%), lived in the red zone (85.9% versus 71.0%), and had lower household income as defined in the category of B40 (51.7% versus 39.3%) compared to those without depression (all p < 0.01). The avoidant coping score was significantly higher (25.43 ± 5.69 versus 20.78 ± 5.65), while the religious coping score was significantly lower (5.10 ± 2.07 versus 5.94 ± 2.11) among those with mild-to-severe depression compared to those without depression (both p < 0.001). Respondents with mild-to-severe depression also had significantly lower mean score in each domain of WHOQOL-BREF compare to those without depression [(physical health, 13.63 ± 2.66 versus 16.20 ± 2.11), (psychological, 12.5 ± 2.79 versus 16.10 ± 2.14), (social relationships, 12.17 ± 3.49 versus 15.28 ± 2.93), environment (14.50 ± 2.39 versus 16.21 ± 2.14), all p < 0.001] after controlling for age, marital status, zone, household income, and coping scores. Conclusion: COVID-19 lockdown had adverse mental health effects. Our study highlighted that approximately one in three individual experienced mild-to-severe depression during the nationwide MCO. The varied impact of the pandemic on mental health could be due to different population characteristics and coping strategies used. Identifying those at higher risk to develop depression during MCO for COVID-19 pandemic could help mental healthcare service providers to plan services for those susceptible, thereby mitigating the pandemic’s effect on quality of life. © 2021, The Author(s).","Coping; Coronavirus; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Mental health; Quality of life",
"Global effect of COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep among 3- to 5-year-old children: a longitudinal study of 14 countries",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106023891&doi=10.1186%2fs12889-021-10852-3&partnerID=40&md5=0cfe632f5ed9a4ad47ffb222d07adc94","Background: The restrictions associated with the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes to young children’s daily routines and habits. The impact on their participation in movement behaviours (physical activity, sedentary screen time and sleep) is unknown. This international longitudinal study compared young children’s movement behaviours before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Parents of children aged 3–5 years, from 14 countries (8 low- and middle-income countries, LMICs) completed surveys to assess changes in movement behaviours and how these changes were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were completed in the 12 months up to March 2020 and again between May and June 2020 (at the height of restrictions). Physical activity (PA), sedentary screen time (SST) and sleep were assessed via parent survey. At Time 2, COVID-19 factors including level of restriction, environmental conditions, and parental stress were measured. Compliance with the World Health Organizations (WHO) Global guidelines for PA (180 min/day [≥60 min moderate- vigorous PA]), SST (≤1 h/day) and sleep (10-13 h/day) for children under 5 years of age, was determined. Results: Nine hundred- forty-eight parents completed the survey at both time points. Children from LMICs were more likely to meet the PA (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AdjOR] = 2.0, 95%Confidence Interval [CI] 1.0,3.8) and SST (AdjOR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.2,3.9) guidelines than their high-income country (HIC) counterparts. Children who could go outside during COVID-19 were more likely to meet all WHO Global guidelines (AdjOR = 3.3, 95%CI 1.1,9.8) than those who were not. Children of parents with higher compared to lower stress were less likely to meet all three guidelines (AdjOR = 0.5, 95%CI 0.3,0.9). Conclusion: PA and SST levels of children from LMICs have been less impacted by COVID-19 than in HICs. Ensuring children can access an outdoor space, and supporting parents’ mental health are important prerequisites for enabling pre-schoolers to practice healthy movement behaviours and meet the Global guidelines. © 2021, The Author(s).","24-h movement behaviours; Low- and middle-income countries; Outdoors; Play; Preschool; Quarantine","exercise; human; longitudinal study; pandemic; preschool child; sleep; Child, Preschool; COVID-19; Exercise; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Sedentary Behavior; Sleep"

With the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many cases of ocular manifestation in association with this disease have been reported. However, as yet we have no complete understanding of this condition. We report here the first case of FBA in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient with coexisting cytomegalovirus (CMV) and COVID-19 infection. Case presentation: A 33-year-old Malay man with underlying acquired immunodeficiency syndrome receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy was referred to the Opthalmology Department with complaints of blurry vision for the past 2 months. He had tested positive for and been diagnosed with COVID-19 1 month previously. Clinical examination of the fundus revealed extensive perivascular sheathing of both the artery and vein suggestive of FBA in the right eye. Laboratory testing of nasal swabs for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum CMV antibody were positive. The patient was then admitted to the COVID-19 ward and treated with intravenous ganciclovir. Conclusion: Clinicians should be aware of and take the necessary standard precautions for possible coexistence of COVID-19 in an immunocompromised patient presenting with blurred vision, eye redness, dry eye and foreign body sensation despite the absence of clinical features suggestive of COVID-19. Whether FBA is one of the ocular signs of co-infection of COVID-19 and CMV remains unknown. Further studies are needed to provide more information on ocular signs presented in patients with concurrent COVID-19 and CMV infections. © 2021, The Author(s).","Coronavirus disease 2019; Cytomegalovirus; Frosted branch angiitis","adult; case report; eye fundus; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; male; retina vasculitis; Adult; COVID-19; Fundus Oculi; HIV; Humans; Male; Retinal Vasculitis; SARS-CoV-2"

Due to geographical challenges and limited resources, clinicians developed novel strategies for managing patients. The use of a dual oxygen concentrator system for mechanical ventilation is one of the innovations developed by retrieval team members from the Emergency Department (ED) of the Sabah Women and Children’s Hospital. Due to conditions requiring isolation of patients suspected of or positive for COVID-19, high-risk patients were treated in an ED extension area that lacked central wall oxygen. Direct access to oxygen tanks became the only viable option, but ensuring a continuous supply was laborious. The novel setup described within this paper has been used on intubated patients in the ED extension area with moderate to high ventilator settings successfully. This simple setup, designed to meet the limited resources within a pandemic environment, needed only a turbine-driven ventilator, two oxygen concentrators, a 3-way connector, and three oxygen tubing. The application of this setup could potentially save more critically ill patients who are being managed in resource-limited conditions such as in smaller district hospitals or out in the field. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"Article; artificial ventilation; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; emergency ward; endotracheal intubation; human; pandemic; priority journal; Sabah"

Malaysia has not been excluded from this COVID-19 pandemic. The resurgence of COVID-19 cases has overwhelmed the public healthcare system and overloaded the healthcare resources. Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia has adopted an Emergency Ordinance (EO) to instruct private hospitals to receive both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients to reduce the strain on public facilities. The treatment of COVID-19 patients at private hospitals could help to boost the bed and critical care occupancy. However, with the absence of insurance coverage because COVID-19 is categorised as pandemic-related diseases, there are some challenges and opportunities posed by the treatment fees management. Another major issue in the collaboration between public and private hospitals is the willingness of private medical consultants to participate in the management of COVID-19 patients, because medical consultants in private hospitals in Malaysia are not hospital employees, but what are termed “private contractors” who provide patient care services to the hospitals. Other collaborative measures with private healthcare providers, e.g. tele-conferencing by private medical clinics to monitor COVID-19 patients and the rollout of national vaccination programme. The public and private healthcare partnership must be enhanced, and continue to find effective ways to collaborate further to combat the pandemic. The MOH, private healthcare sectors and insurance providers need to have a synergistic COVID-19 treatment plans to ensure public as well as insurance policy holders have equal opportunities for COVID-19 screening tests, vaccinations and treatment. © 2021, The Author(s).","Collaborative measures; COVID-19; Insurance providers; Ministry of Health Malaysia; Private healthcare sectors","coronavirus disease 2019; health care personnel; health care planning; health insurance; hospital bed utilization; human; insurance; intensive care; Malaysia; Note; pandemic; patient monitoring; private hospital; private sector; public sector; public-private partnership; teleconference; vaccination"

National representative samples were collected from 24 countries (N = 25,435). The main predictors were (1) perceived risk to contract coronavirus, (2) perceived risk to suffer economic losses due to coronavirus, and (3) their interaction effect. Individual and country-level variables were added as covariates in multilevel regression models. We examined compliance with various preventive health behaviors and support for strict containment policies. Results show that perceived economic risk consistently predicted mitigation behavior and policy support—and its effects were positive. Perceived health risk had mixed effects. Only two significant interactions between health and economic risk were identified—both positive. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"communicable disease control; employment; epidemiology; health behavior; health status; human; isolation and purification; pandemic; perception; prevention and control; risk; work; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Employment; Health Behavior; Health Status; Humans; Pandemics; Perception; Risk; SARS-CoV-2; Work"

Although vaccination process has already started, reaching sufficient availability will take time. Considering the impact of this widespread disease, many research attempts have been made by the computer scientists to screen the COVID-19 from Chest X-Rays (CXRs) or Computed Tomography (CT) scans. To this end, we have proposed GraphCovidNet, a Graph Isomorphic Network (GIN) based model which is used to detect COVID-19 from CT-scans and CXRs of the affected patients. Our proposed model only accepts input data in the form of graph as we follow a GIN based architecture. Initially, pre-processing is performed to convert an image data into an undirected graph to consider only the edges instead of the whole image. Our proposed GraphCovidNet model is evaluated on four standard datasets: SARS-COV-2 Ct-Scan dataset, COVID-CT dataset, combination of covid-chestxray-dataset, Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset and CMSC-678-ML-Project dataset. The model shows an impressive accuracy of 99% for all the datasets and its prediction capability becomes 100% accurate for the binary classification problem of detecting COVID-19 scans.

"Exploring fear of COVID-19 and its correlates among older adults in Bangladesh",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104418144&doi=10.1186%2fs12992-021-00698-0&partnerID=40&md5=4790586cc1d9068a53ee0a73663cca46","Objective: This study was aimed to assess the perceived fear of COVID-19 and its associated factors among older adults in Bangladesh. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2020 among 1032 older Bangladeshi adults aged ≥60 years. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information on participants’ characteristics and COVID-19 related information. Perceived fear of COVID-19 was measured using the seven-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), where the cumulative score ranged from 7 to 35. Multiple linear regression was performed to identify factors associated with perceived fear of COVID-19. Results: The mean fear score was 19.4. Participants who were concerned about COVID-19 (β: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.71 to 3.78) and overwhelmed by COVID-19 (β: 3.31, 95% CI: 2.33 to 4.29) were significantly more likely to be fearful of COVID-19. Moreover, older adults who felt themselves isolated from others and whose close friends and family members were diagnosed with COVID-19 were more fearful. However, the participants who received COVID-19 related information from the health workers had a lower level of fear (β: -1.90, 95% CI: − 3.06 to − 0.73). Conclusions: The presence of overwhelming fear of COVID-19 among the older adults of Bangladesh underlines the psychological needs of these vulnerable groups. Health workers have a key role in addressing these needs and further research is needed to identify the effective strategies for them to use. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bangladesh; COVID-19; FCV-19S; Fear; Older adults","adult; correlation; COVID-19; elderly population; health care; health risk; mental health; Bangladesh; access to information; aged; anxiety; Bangladesh; cross-sectional study; etiology; fear; female; human; male; mental stress; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; social isolation; very elderly; Access to Information; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Social Isolation; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"The prevalence and clinical significance of Presymptomatic COVID-19 patients: how we can be one step ahead in mitigating a deadly pandemic",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102272810&doi=10.1186%2fs12879-021-05849-7&partnerID=40&md5=7adfd5ac6c471a72a614b8b7c27a4e08","Background: Presymptomatic COVID-19 patients have been identified as a major stumbling block in efforts to break the chain of transmission. Studies on temporal dynamics of its shedding suggests it peaks 1–2 days prior to any symptom onset. Therefore, a large proportion of patients are actively spreading the disease unknowingly whilst undetected. However, lengthy lockdowns and isolation leads to a host of socioeconomic issues and are impractical. Conversely, there exists no study describing this group and their clinical significance despite their key role in disease transmission. Methods: As a result, we devised a retrospective study to look at the prevalence of presymptomatic patients with COVID-19 from data sourced via our medical records office. Subsequently, we identify early indicators of infection through demographic information, biochemical and radiological abnormalities which would allow early diagnosis and isolation. In addition, we will look into the clinical significance of this group and their outcome; if it differs from asymptomatic or symptomatic patients. Descriptive statistics were used in addition to tabulating the variables and corresponding values for reference. Variables are compared between the presymptomatic group and others via Chi-square testing and Fisher’s exact test, accepting a p value of < 0.05 as significant. Results: Our analysis shows a higher proportion of presymptomatic patients with atypical symptoms like chest pain while symptomatic patients commonly present with respiratory symptoms like cough and shortness of breath. Besides that, there were more females presenting as presymptomatic patients compared to males (p = 0.019) and these group of patients were likely to receive treatment (p < 0.001). Otherwise, we were not able to identify other statistically significant markers suggesting a patient is presymptomatic. Conclusion: As we have little means of identifying these silent spreaders, it highlights further the importance of general measures implemented to stop COVID-19 transmission like social distancing, face mask, and widespread testing. © 2021, The Author(s).","Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; Presymptomatic; SARS-CoV-2","azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; interferon; lopinavir plus ritonavir; tocilizumab; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019; child; clinical feature; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; contact examination; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; female; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; nasopharyngeal swab; oropharyngeal swab; prevalence; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sex difference; symptom; thorax pain; thorax radiography; asymptomatic infection; communicable disease control; diagnosis; Malaysia; middle aged; pandemic; preschool child; prevalence; symptom assessment; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asymptomatic Infections; Child; Child, Preschool; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Symptom Assessment; Young Adult"

Therefore, we designed this study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and the effectiveness and attitudes towards online education among Chinese children aged 7–15 years. Methods: A detailed questionnaire, comprising of 62 questions was designed and parents or caretakers of 7 to 15 years old children were invited to participate via WeChat, a multi-purpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app, which is widely used by the Chinese population. A total of 668 parents across different regions of China were included. Results: During COVID-19 pandemic, 20.7 and 7.2% children report experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PTSD and SMFQ-P scores are significantly higher in middle school and boarding school students compared to primary and day school students. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that school system and province of origin are factors significantly associated with developing PSTD symptoms. 44.3% respondents feel online education is effective in gaining knowledge and improving practical and communications skills. 78.0% believe the online education system is efficient. Overall 79.8% respondents are satisfied and children can adapt to this new education system. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we found 1 in five children have PTSD and 1 in 14 children have depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In summary, COVID-19 epidemic has caused PTSD and depression symptoms among Chinese children aged 7 to 15 years. In general, a large proportion of respondents are satisfied with online education, but still a substantial proportion of students are not comfortable with this new form of learning. Authorities should optimize online education systems and implement effective interventions to cope with the psychological effects of COVID-19 on children, as it is affecting the global population and remains uncertain when it will end. © 2021, The Author(s).","Children; China; COVID-19; Mental health; Online education","adolescent; age distribution; Article; caregiver; child; Chinese; communication skill; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; depression assessment; e-learning; female; geographic distribution; human; major clinical study; male; mental health; middle school; multivariate logistic regression analysis; online system; pandemic; parental attitude; posttraumatic stress disorder; prevalence; primary school; questionnaire; risk factor; school child; Short Mood and Feeling questionnaire parent; social media; student attitude; China; depression; pandemic; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychology; Adolescent; Child; China; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Surveys and Questionnaires"

Here, we estimate the potential number of lives saved and life years gained if this treatment were to be rolled out in the UK and globally, as well as the cost-effectiveness of implementing this intervention. Assuming SARS-CoV-2 exposure levels of 5% to 15%, we estimate that, for the UK, approximately 12,000 (4,250 - 27,000) lives could be saved between July and December 2020. Assuming that dexamethasone has a similar effect size in settings where access to oxygen therapies is limited, this would translate into approximately 650,000 (240,000 - 1,400,000) lives saved globally over the same time period. If dexamethasone acts differently in these settings, the impact could be less than half of this value. To estimate the full potential of dexamethasone in the global fight against COVID-19, it is essential to perform clinical research in settings with limited access to oxygen and/or ventilators, for example in low- and middle-income countries. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"dexamethasone; dexamethasone; COVID-19; disease treatment; economic impact; health impact; mortality; spatiotemporal analysis; viral disease; Article; artificial ventilation; assisted ventilation; clinical research; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; coughing; drug efficacy; dyspnea; economic evaluation; fatigue; fever; health care policy; health economics; hospital admission; hospital patient; hospitalization cost; human; intensive care; lowest income group; middle income country; middle income group; mortality; myalgia; nonhuman; oxygen therapy; quality adjusted life year; respiratory distress; respiratory tract disease; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distancing; treatment outcome; United Kingdom; cost benefit analysis; drug therapy; economics; epidemiology; hospital mortality; hospitalization; mechanical ventilator; therapy; United Kingdom; SARS coronavirus; Cost-Benefit Analysis; COVID-19; Dexamethasone; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Humans; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Respiration, Artificial; SARS-CoV-2; United Kingdom; Ventilators, Mechanical"

Here, we report an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor based on isothermal rolling circle amplification (RCA) for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. The assay involves the hybridization of the RCA amplicons with probes that were functionalized with redox active labels that are detectable by an electrochemical biosensor. The one-step sandwich hybridization assay could detect as low as 1 copy/μL of N and S genes, in less than 2 h. Sensor evaluation with 106 clinical samples, including 41 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 9 samples positive for other respiratory viruses, gave a 100% concordance result with qRT-PCR, with complete correlation between the biosensor current signals and quantitation cycle (Cq) values.

Initial understanding was that transmission originated from respiratory droplets from an infected host to a susceptible host. However, indirect contact transmission of viable virus by fomites and through aerosols has also been suggested. Herein, we report the involvement of fine indoor air particulates with a diameter of ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5) as the virus’s transport agent. PM2.5 was collected over four weeks during 48-h measurement intervals in four separate hospital wards containing different infected clusters in a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Our results indicated the highest SARS-CoV-2 RNA on PM2.5 in the ward with number of occupants. We suggest a link between the virus-laden PM2.5 and the ward’s design.

Although this is not meant as a complete substitute, critics argue that online education has widened the ‘diploma disease’ crisis. They argued that this would lead to serious long-term problems which may become irreversible. This comparative study was conducted using an ‘empirical survey’ with 120 students from each group (before and during COVID-19, giving a total of 240 samples/students) to conduct an in-depth study of the academic and job-ready performance of graduates. Findings show that pre-pandemic students did poorly academically compared to during-pandemic counterparts. On the other hand, pre-pandemic graduates achieved better job-readiness scores which included both aptitude and practicum. Moreover, both groups achieved well in terms of academic performance compared to their job-readiness scores. This leads to the question: is it the role of HE to value the concept of sustainable production or to produce certificates/qualifications? Apparently, the HE system has used COVID-19 as an excuse to extend the “diploma disease crisis”, a situation that must be addressed by devising a proper policy framework. © 2021","COVID-19; Diploma disease; Higher education; Online technology; Sustainable production","E-learning; Students; Comparatives studies; COVID-19; Diploma disease; Empirical surveys; High educations; Job readiness; Long-term problems; On-line education; Online technology; Sustainable production; Sustainable development"

In China and many other nations, universities have introduced compulsory remote education programs such as mobile learning (m-learning) to prevent public health hazards caused by the pandemic. However, so far, there is still a lack of understanding of student's learning experience responses in compulsory m-learning programs. As such, there is a necessity to explore the factors and mechanisms which drives students’ experience. This paper evaluates the influence of both pedagogy and technology on learner's compulsory m-learning experience response (ER) by extending the mobile technology acceptance model (MTAM) during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data, which was then analysed through SmartPLS 3.2.9. Importance-performance matrix analysis was applied as a post-hoc procedure to gauge the importance and performance of the exogenous constructs. The results revealed that perceptions of m-learning's learning content quality, user interface, and system's connectivity affect the perceived mobile usefulness and easiness which in turn affects ER. This paper validates MTAM in the field of education by integrating MTAM with pedagogy and technology attributes under a social emergency setting such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the current research explains users' ER rather than behaviour intention which is commonly adopted in past studies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Mobile learning; Mobile technology acceptance model; Pedagogy; PLS-SEM","Digital storage; E-learning; Education computing; Health hazards; Learning systems; Students; User interfaces; Behaviour intentions; Education industry; Learning contents; Learning experiences; Mobile Technology; Performance matrices; Remote education; Self-administered questionnaire; Engineering education"

With this in mind, the present study examines the performance of academic and job-readiness of two groups of graduates. One group comprised a pre-COVID-19 cohort for face-to-face teaching mode while the other used the online mode during the pandemic. While the official secondary data are collected from the sampled university, primary data are gathered through an ‘empirical survey’ of 120 students in each group (i.e., before and during COVID-19, a total of 240). Findings suggest that the pre-pandemic group did poorly academically unlike their during-pandemic counterparts. Although both groups achieved well academically, there is a difference when comparing their job-readiness scores which included both aptitude and practicum tests. The pre-COVID-19 students achieved better job-readiness scores than their counterparts. Performance in academy and job-readiness is not proportionately linked. These findings suggest that higher education is generally not that active from the job market perspective, while online learning has in fact made education much more passive.

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized trials. Patients: Databases of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL were systematically searched from its inception until March 2021. Interventions: COVID-19 patients being positioned in the prone position either whilst awake or mechanically ventilated. Measurements: Primary outcomes were oxygenation parameters (PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio, PaCO₂, SpO₂). Secondary outcomes included the rate of intubation and mortality rate. Results: Thirty-five studies (n = 1712 patients) were included in this review. In comparison to the supine group, prone position significantly improved the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio (study = 13, patients = 1002, Mean difference, MD 52.15, 95% CI 37.08 to 67.22; p < 0.00001) and SpO₂ (study = 11, patients = 998, MD 4.17, 95% CI 2.53 to 5.81; p ≤0.00001). Patients received prone position were associated with lower incidence of mortality (study = 5, patients = 688, Odd ratio, OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.80; p = 0.007). No significant difference was noted in the incidence of intubation rate (study = 5, patients = 626, OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.86; p = 0.42) between the supine and prone groups. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that prone position improved PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio with better SpO₂ than supine position in COVID-19 patients. Given the limited number of studies with small sample size and substantial heterogeneity of measured outcomes, further studies are warranted to standardize the regime of prone position to improve the certainty of evidence.

Regrettably, the global population and consumption demands are increasing ceaselessly, leading to the need for more resources for food production, which could potentially aggravate the sustainability and ecosystem degradation issues, while stimulating drastic climate change. Meanwhile, the unexpected emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and some implemented measures to combat its spread disrupted agricultural activities and the food supply chain, which also led to a reduction in ecosystem carbonization. This study sets out to explore policy framework and selected feasible actions that are being adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could potentially reduce the emissions even after the pandemic to promote a resilient and sustainable agri-food system. In this study, we reviewed 27 articles that focus on the current state of the agri-food system in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the decarbonization of the agroecosystem. This review has taken the form of a systematic methodology in analyzing the adoption and implementation of various measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 on the impact of the agri-food system and reduction in ecosystem degradation. Up to 0.3 Mt of CO2 reduction from the agri-food system alone was reportedly achieved during the first 6 months of the pandemic in 23 European countries. The various adopted measures indicate that the circular economy approach is a panacea to achieve the needed sustainability in the agri-food system. Also, it dictates a need for a paradigm change towards improvement on localized food production that promotes sustainable production and consumption. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; COVID-19; Production and consumption; Supply chain; Sustainable agri-food system","Carbonization; Climate change; Decarbonization; Ecosystems; Food supply; Sustainable development; % reductions; Agri-food system; Agro-ecosystems; Circular economy; COVID-19; Decarbonisation; Ecosystem degradation; Food production; Production and consumption; Sustainable agri-food system; Supply chains"

The impact of physicochemical variables on virus vitality and spread should be taken into account in experimental and clinical studies. Another avenue to explore is the effect of diet and its interaction with the immune system on SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rate. Past year have witnessed extensive studies on virus and pathophysiology of the COVID-19 disease and the cellular mechanisms of virus spreading. However, our knowledge has not reached a level where we plan an efficient therapeutic approach to prevent the virus entry to the cells or decreasing the spreading and morbidity in severe cases of disease. The risk of infection directly correlates with the control of virus spreading via droplets and aerosol transmission, as well as patient immune system response. A key goal in virus restriction and transmission rate is to understand the physicochemical structure of aerosol and droplet formation, and the parameters that affect the droplet-borne and airborne in different environmental conditions. The lifetime of droplets on different surfaces is described based on the contact angle. Hereby, we recommend regular use of high-quality face masks in high temperature and low humidity conditions. However, in humid and cold weather conditions, wearing gloves and frequently hand washing, gain a higher priority. Additionally, social distancing rules should be respected in all aforementioned conditions. We will also discuss different routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells and how multiple genetic factors play a role in the spread of the virus. Given the role of environmental and nutritional factors, we discuss and recommend some strategies to prevent the disease and protect the population against COVID-19.

The host country and participating countries need to institute effective measures for a safer and healthier Hajj pilgrimage. In the immediate Hajj season during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of pilgrims need to be reduced to the optimum number that can be managed individual countries’ Hajj missions. Beside proof COVID-19 clearance before travelling and completed Covid-19 vaccination, the stay in KSA should be shortened for Hajj ritual only. The participating countries responsible to thoroughly select individuals with low risk of severe infections, provide health education program, offer all compulsory and recommended vaccines and allocate adequate healthcare/isolation centres in KSA. The participating countries are also liable to prepare adequate quarantine places for hajj pilgrims when returning home. Individual pilgrims are responsible to prevent respiratory pathogens from spreading. Prior to departure for Hajj, they need to undergo a thorough medical examination, received all compulsory and recommended vaccines and follow health education program. During Hajj, they need to follow instructions by Hajj authorities, practicing proper hygiene, wearing a face mask and avoid crowded places.

Methods: VigiBase data were used to analyze the reported ADEs linked to HCQ. The data were analyzed based on age, gender, and seriousness of ADEs at the System Organ Classification level and the individual Preferred Term level. Results: The majority were above 18 years(91.6%) and from Europe(41.6%). A total of 5,315 ADEs were associated with HCQ use in COVID-19. Of these, 918 ADEs were attributed to CVS and reported from 773 patients. Grossly, CVS ADEs were associated with concomitant use of HCQ and azithromycin(AZM), and only 40 ADEs were solely due to HCQ. The majority were serious (69.3%) and resolved afterward (51%). In CVS ADEs, there were 366 cardiac disorders, 38 vascular disorders, and 514 ADEs under investigation. Among the cardiac disorders, palpitation was the most typical (N=65), followed by bradycardia(N=44) and tachycardia(N=33).

This impact is usually underestimated in particular in developing countries. Objectives: The study aims to assess the level of anxiety, depression, risk perception, and coping strategies of Albanian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional online study was conducted from April to May 2020 by recruiting health care personnel through the snowballing method. Data collection was carried out through social media using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) by Google forms. Participants were recruited from all health care sectors including doctors, nurses, etc. working in both the public and private sectors. Results: 410 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Most participants were nurses (59.3%), female (78.5%), and belonged to the age group 26–40 years (46.3%). Mild levels of anxiety were expressed in 26.9% of participants while 7.2% of them expressed moderate levels. 23.1% and 12.1% of participants expressed respectively mild and moderate depression levels. High levels of risk perception were found. A statistical association was found between occupation (p = 0.011), gender (p = 0.031), providing care for COVID-19 patients (p = 0.011), and the availably of mental health support in the workplace. Poor coping strategies were reported among participants. Conclusions: Mental health support should be a priority of the healthcare system in particular for young health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients.

The mediating role of impulse buying and the moderating role of neuroticism on food waste during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were also uncovered in this study. A self-administered online survey was distributed to a total of 274 consumers who had experienced a lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak and were also regular buyers of food. Empirical findings supported the fact that social media usage, neuroticism, and impulse buying were positively related to food waste. Impulse buying mediates the relationship between social media usage and food waste, as well as between neuroticism and food waste. The study results also revealed that neuroticism positively moderates the relationship between social media usage and food waste.

Objectives: This paper assesses the initial responses of major farming and food systems to COVID-19 in 25 Asian countries, and considers the implications for resilience, food and nutrition security and recovery policies by the governments. Methods: A conceptual systems model was specified including key pathways linking the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 to the resilience and performance of the four principal Asian farming and food systems, viz, lowland rice based; irrigated wheat based; hill mixed; and dryland mixed systems. Based on this framework, a systematic survey of 2504 key informants (4% policy makers, 6% researchers or University staff, 6% extension workers, 65% farmers, and 19% others) in 20 Asian countries was conducted and the results assessed and analysed. Results and conclusion: The principal Asian farming and food systems were moderately resilient to COVID-19, reinforced by government policies in many countries that prioritized food availability and affordability. Rural livelihoods and food security were affected primarily because of disruptions to local labour markets (especially for off-farm work), farm produce markets (notably for perishable foods) and input supply chains (i.e., seeds and fertilisers). The overall effects on system performance were most severe in the irrigated wheat based system and least severe in the hill mixed system, associated in the latter case with greater resilience and diversification and less dependence on external inputs and long market chains. Farming and food systems' resilience and sustainability are critical considerations for recovery policies and programmes, especially in relation to economic performance that initially recovered more slowly than productivity, natural resources status and social capital. Overall, the resilience of Asian farming and food systems was strong because of inherent systems characteristics reinforced by public policies that prioritized staple food production and distribution as well as complementary welfare programmes. With the substantial risks to plant- and animal-sourced food supplies from future zoonoses and the institutional vulnerabilities revealed by COVID-19, efforts to improve resilience should be central to recovery programmes. Significance: This study was the first Asia-wide systems assessment of the effects of COVID-19 on agriculture and food systems, differentiating the effects of the pandemic across the four principal regional farming and food systems in the region. © 2021","Agrifood-systems; COVID-19; Gender; Markets; Policy; Resilience","COVID-19; food availability; food market; food production; natural resource; public sector; risk assessment; sustainability; wheat; Asia"

Although temperature testing is suggested as a first-line test for COVID-19, it was not reliable because many diseases have the same symptoms. Thus, we propose a deep learning method based on X-ray images that used a convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning (TL) for COVID-19 diagnosis, and using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technique for producing visual explanations for the COVID-19 infection area in the lung. The low sample size of coronavirus samples was considered a challenge, thus, this issue was overridden using data augmentation techniques. The study found that the proposed (CNN) and the modified pre-trained networks VGG16 and InceptionV3 achieved a promising result for COVID-19 diagnosis by using chest X-ray images. The proposed CNN was able to differentiate 284 patients with COVID-19 or normal with 98.2 percent for training accuracy and 96.66 percent for test accuracy and 100.0 percent sensitivity. The modified VGG16 achieved the best classification result between all with 100.0 percent for training accuracy and 98.33 percent for test accuracy and 100.0 percent sensitivity, but the proposed CNN overcame the others in the side of reducing the computational complexity and training time significantly. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Methods: An anonymous Internet-based study was conducted between 23 April and 26 June 2020. During the study period, the country underwent phase 3 and phase 4 of the Movement Control Order (MCO), Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO), and Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO). Psychological distress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a 14-item self-assessment scale for measuring distress (total HADS score; HADS-T) with two subscales, namely, anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). Perceived threat of infection was measured based on the health belief model. Results: From a total of 631 responses received, the proportion of participants with anxiety and depression symptoms (above threshold score of 8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) was 29.0 and 20.9%, respectively. Psychological distress (HADS-T > 16) was reported in 22.3% of the respondents. A total of 16.5% had combined anxiety and depression symptoms. The highest HADS-A (6.10; 95% CI 5.64–6.56), HADS-D (5.61; 95% CI 5.14–6.08), and HADS-T (11.71; 95% CI 10.84–12.58) scores were reported among respondents during phase 4 of the MCO. Partial least square-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) revealed that self-perceived health status, perceived susceptibility, and severity of COVID-19 have the greatest effect, leading to higher HADS-A, HADS-D, and HADS-T scores. Conclusion: Heightened psychological distress was evident in cancer survivors particularly during the enforcement of the MCO over COVID-19.

In this study, salivary samples of COVID-19 patients collected from 6 patients with the median age of 58.5 years, ranging from 34 to 72 years (2 females and 4 males) were analyzed using an Au/fiber Bragg grating (FBG) probe decorated with GO. The probe measures the prevalence of positivity in saliva and the association between the virus density and changes to sensing elements. When the probe is immersed in patients’ saliva, deviation of the detected light wavelength and intensity from healthy saliva indicate the presence of the virus and confirms infection. For a patient in the hyperinflammatory phase of desease, who has virus density of 1.2 × 108 copies/mL in saliva, the maximum wavelength shift and intensity changes after 1600 s were shown to be 1.12 nm and 2.01 dB, respectively. While for a patient in the early infection phase with 1.6 × 103 copies/mL, these values were 0.98 nm and 1.32 dB.

Here, we described a protocol for targeted multiplex full genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA directly extracted from human nasopharyngeal swabs using the Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM). This protocol involves concomitant amplification of 237 gene fragments encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 genome to increase the abundance and yield of viral specific sequencing reads. Five complete and one near-complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were generated with a single Ion PGM sequencing run. The sequence coverage analysis revealed two amplicons (positions 13 751-13 965 and 23 941-24 106), which consistently gave low sequencing read coverage in all isolates except 4Apr20-64Hu. We analyzed the potential primer binding sites within these low covered regions and noted that the 4Apr20-64-Hu possess C at positions 13 730 and 23 929, whereas the other isolates possess T at these positions. The genome nucleotide variations observed suggest that the naturally occurring variations present in the actively circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains affected the performance of the target enrichment panel of the Ion AmpliSeq™ SARS CoV 2 Research Panel.

Methods: We recruited 81 travelers and 15 non-travelers (including ten controls) prospectively within a mean of 3·22 days of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. Each study participant provided 2 mls of early morning fresh drooled whole saliva separately into a sterile plastic container and GeneFiX™ saliva collection kit. The saliva specimens were processed within 4 h and tested for SARS-CoV-2 genes (E, RdRP, and N2) and the results compared to paired NPS RT-PCR for diagnostic accuracy. Results: Majority of travellers were asymptomatic (75·0%) with a mean age of 34·26 years. 77 travelers were RT-PCR positive at the time of hospitalization whilst three travelers had positive contacts. In this group, the detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 with NPS, whole saliva, and GeneFiX™ were comparable (89·3%, 50/56; 87·8%, 43/49; 89·6%, 43/48). Both saliva collection methods were in good agreement (Kappa = 0·69). There was no statistical difference between the detection rates of saliva and NPS (p > 0·05). Detection was highest for the N2 gene whilst the E gene provided the highest viral load (mean = 27·96 to 30·10, SD = 3·14 to 3·85). Saliva specimens have high sensitivity (80·4%) and specificity (90·0%) with a high positive predictive value of 91·8% for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Conclusion: Saliva for SARS-CoV-2 screening is a simple accurate technique comparable with NPS RT-PCR. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aviation; COVID-19; Ct. value; RT-PCR; Travel medicine","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019; child; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cycle threshold value; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; ethnicity; female; gene identification; hospitalization; human; human cell; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; nasopharyngeal swab; predictive value; prospective study; real time polymerase chain reaction; saliva analysis; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex difference; virus detection; virus gene; virus load"

This study aimed to examine the impact of the lockdown on glycaemic control and lifestyle changes in children and adolescents with type 1 (T1DM) and 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) aged less than 18 years old. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, interviews and a standardised questionnaire comparing lifestyle changes before and during the lockdown were performed in follow-up clinic visits after the lockdown. Anthropometry measurements and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values were compared 3 months prior and after the lockdown. Results: Participants were 93 patients with T1DM (11.08 ± 3.47 years) and 30 patients with T2DM (13.81 ± 2.03 years). Male gender, T2DM and pubertal adolescents were found to have a significant deterioration in glycaemic control. A significant increment of HbA1c was observed in patients with T2DM (8.5 ± 0.40 vs 9.9 ± 0.46%), but not in patients with T1DM (8.6 ± 0.28 vs 8.7 ± 0.33%). Contrarily, there was an improved glycaemic control in pre-pubertal T1DM children likely due to parental supervision during home confinement. Weight and BMI SDS increased in T1DM patients but surprisingly reduced in T2DM patients possibly due to worsening diabetes control. Reduced meal frequency mainly due to skipping breakfast, reduced physical activity level scores, increased screen time and sleep duration were observed in both groups. Conclusions: Adverse impact on glycaemic control and lifestyle were seen mostly in patients with T2DM and pubertal adolescent boys. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Children and adolescents; COVID-19 pandemic; Glycaemic control; Lockdown; Type 1 diabetes mellitus; Type 2 diabetes mellitus","antidiabetic agent; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; metformin; glycosylated hemoglobin; adolescent; anthropometry; Article; behavior change; body mass; body weight; breakfast skipping; child; continuous infusion; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; diabetes control; female; follow up; glycemic control; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; interview; lifestyle modification; lockdown; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; meal frequency; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; parental behavior; patient compliance; physical activity; puberty; questionnaire; school child; screen time; sex difference; sleep time; communicable disease control; glycemic control; lifestyle; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Adolescent; Child; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Glycemic Control; Humans; Life Style; Male; SARS-CoV-2"

Accordingly, the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), including medical face masks, has sharply risen compared with 2019. The new situation has led to a sharp increase in energy demand and the environmental impacts associated with these product systems. Hence, the pandemic's effects on the environmental consequences of various PPE types, such as medical face masks, should be assessed. In light of that, the current study aimed to identify the environmental hot-spots of medical face mask production and consumption by using life cycle assessment (LCA) and tried to provide solutions to mitigate the adverse impacts. Based on the results obtained, in 2020, medical face masks production using fossil-based plastics causes the loss of 2.03 × 103 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs); 1.63 × 108 PDF*m2*yr damage to ecosystem quality; the climate-damaging release of 2.13 × 109 kg CO2eq; and 5.65 × 1010 MJ damage to resources. Besides, annual medical face mask production results in 5.88 × 104 TJ demand for exergy. On the other hand, if used makes are not appropriately handled, they can lead to 4.99 × 105 Pt/yr additional damage to the environment in 2020 as determined by the EDIP 2003. Replacement of fossil-based plastics with bio-based plastics, at rates ranging from 10 to 100%, could mitigate the product's total yearly environmental damage by 4–43%, respectively.

Drawing upon the concept of cognitive destination image and through an online self-administered survey, the effects of four factors including trust, crisis management, healthcare system, and solidarity on travel behavioral intention are compared based on tourists’ prior experience of a given destination. To achieve this aim, ten countries with different coping strategies, numbers of positive cases and mortality rate were studied. A total number of 518 useable questionnaires were collected from the prospect international tourists who followed news related to COVID-19 for one of the selected countries and plan to travel in the future. Partial least squares – structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis were used to test the model and hypotheses. The results showed the high predictive power of the model on post COVID-19 travel behavioral intention. The findings revealed the strong and positive effects of trust and healthcare system on behavioral intention of respondents without past experience to visit a destination, whereas the effect of solidarity on behavioral intention was identified much stronger for the prospect tourists with past experience of visiting a destination. This research provides unique theoretical contributions by investigating the effects of trust, crisis management, healthcare system, and solidarity shaped by media during COVID-19 outbreak as the components of cognitive destination image on future behavioral intention across past experience of visiting a destination.

Applying behavioral inhibition system theory, reactance theory, and expectancy theory, this research examines how psychological factors such as uncertainty, perceptions of severity, perceptions of scarcity, and anxiety affected the panic purchasing behavior of consumers. This study was conducted in Malaysia in light of the 2020 outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from structural equation modeling indicate that uncertainty, and perceptions of scarcity are positively associated with anxiety but not with the panic purchasing behavior of consumers.

Currently, most government efforts seek to avoid disseminating the coronavirus and forecast probable hot areas. The most susceptible to coronaviral infection are the healthcare staff due to their daily contact with potential patients. This article proposes a COVID-19 real-time system for tracking and identifying the suspected cases using an Internet of Things platform for capturing user symptoms and notify the authority. The proposed framework addressed four main components: (1) real-time symptom data collection via thermal scanning algorithm, (2) facial recognition algorithm, (3) a data analysis that uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, and (4) a cloud infrastructure. A monitoring experiment was conducted to test three different ages, kid, middle, and older, considering the scanning distance influence compared with contact wearable sensors. The results show that 99.9% accuracy was achieved within a (500 ± 5) cm distance, and this accuracy tends to decrease as the distance the camera scanning and objects increased. The results also revealed that the scanning system's accuracy had been slightly changed as the environmental temperature dropped lower than 27 °C. Based on the high-temperature presence's simulated environment, the system demonstrated an effective and instant response via sending email and MQTT message to the person in charge of providing accurate identification of potential cases of COVID-19. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Communication module; COVID-19; MQTT message; Real-time monitoring system; Smart infrastructure",

To expedite drug discovery, a computational approach is widely employed for the initial screening of anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates. This study aimed to investigate the potential of peptides from quinoa seed proteins as multi-target antagonists against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain, main protease, and papain-like protease. Five quinoa proteins were hydrolyzed in silico by papain and subtilisin. Among the 1465 peptides generated, seven could interact stably with the key binding residues and catalytic residues of the viral targets, mainly via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The seven peptides were comparable or superior to previously reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 peptides based on docking scores. Key residues in the seven peptides contributing to binding to viral targets were determined by computational alanine scanning. The seven peptides were predicted in silico to be non-toxic and non-allergenic. The peptides ranged between 546.66 and 3974.87 g/mol in molecular mass, besides exhibiting basic and cationic properties (isoelectric points: 8.26–12.10; net charges: 0.1–4.0). Among the seven peptides, VEDKGMMHQQRMMEKAMNIPRMCGTMQRKCRMS was found to bind the largest number of key residues on the targets. In conclusion, seven putative non-toxic, non-allergenic, multi-target anti-SARS-CoV-2 peptides were identified from quinoa seed proteins.

A surge of positive cases ensued by March 2020 which led to a series of countrywide containment and mitigation measures known as Movement Control Order (MCO). We study the direct effects of MCO on the course of epidemic by analyzing the cumulative and daily infection cases of COVID-19 up to 31 December 2020 in Malaysia and its states using piecewise linear regression and segment neighborhoods algorithm of change-point analysis, respectively. Through piecewise regression on nationwide cases, MCO were likely to almost flatten the epidemic curve in just one month after it was first initiated. While for stateswise cases, the average length of series of concave downward is six months before it turn to concave upward, indicating the period of which deceleration of new cases can be expected. However, the starting of this wave of COVID-19 can be relatively vary for three months in different states and federal territories. Together with change-point analysis on daily cases, the statewise epidemic phases could be subdivided into two to four regimes, whereby the majority of phase transitions fall in April and last quarter of 2020.

The COVID-19 forecast on infections is significant and crucial information that will help in executing policies and effectively reducing the daily cases. Filtering techniques are important ways to model dynamic structures because they provide good valuations over the recursive Bayesian updates. Kalman filters, one of the filtering techniques, are useful in the studying of contagious infections. Kalman filter algorithm performs an important role in the development of actual and comprehensive approaches to inhibit, learn, react, and reduce spreadable disorder outbreaks in people. The purpose of this paper is to forecast COVID-19 infections using the Kalman filter method. The Kalman filter (KF) was applied for the four most affected countries, namely the United States, India, Brazil, and Russia. Based on the results obtained, the KF method is capable of keeping track of the real COVID-19 data in nearly all scenarios.

"Psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Malaysian families: A cross-sectional study",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113800495&doi=10.1136%2fbmjopen-2021-050523&partnerID=40&md5=98adaf8bb2f9a1cf983d449f13096343","Objective To investigate the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on Malaysian families. Design A cross-sectional study performed using an anonymous online questionnaire distributed through social media, email and the Department of Social Welfare. Setting Malaysian families were invited to answer the questionnaires. The sampling was performed between 12 May 2020 and 9 June 2020. Intervention The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES). The mental health status was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) 21. Main outcome measure (1) Psychological impact on Malaysian families. (2) Prevalence of mental health status of Malaysian families during COVID-19 pandemic. Result A total of 409 Malaysian families have responded (409 parents and 348 children), 154 respondents (38%) reported high psychological impact (score 14) for psychological construct and 189 respondents (46%) reported high psychological impact (score 6) for behavioural construct. A significantly higher proportion of respondents with not permanent employment status of the family lead reported high psychological impact. The prevalence of anxiety reported from family respondents was 23%. Forty-five children answered the DASS-21 questionnaire; 28.5% reported anxiety, 31.4% reported depression and 13.3% reported stress. The job security status of the family lead was found to be the predictive factor for the mean total IES-R score (psychological construct) and ethnicity for mean total CRIES-8 and CRIES-13. Conclusion Rates of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic were high. Findings suggest that urgent measures to ensure job security among Malaysian families are important to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychosocial and mental health outcomes. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

"Association between Administration of IL-6 Antagonists and Mortality among Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Meta-analysis",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112256383&doi=10.1001%2fjama.2021.11330&partnerID=40&md5=5ec40f8b5f37aa0db95d9020420c8d51","Importance: Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of IL-6 antagonists in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have variously reported benefit, no effect, and harm. Objective: To estimate the association between administration of IL-6 antagonists compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality and other outcomes. Data Sources: Trials were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases between October 2020 and January 2021. Searches were not restricted by trial status or language. Additional trials were identified through contact with experts. Study Selection: Eligible trials randomly assigned patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to a group in whom IL-6 antagonists were administered and to a group in whom neither IL-6 antagonists nor any other immunomodulators except corticosteroids were administered. Among 72 potentially eligible trials, 27 (37.5%) met study selection criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: In this prospective meta-analysis, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) for 28-day all-cause mortality. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. There were 9 secondary outcomes including progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death and risk of secondary infection by 28 days. Results: A total of 10930 patients (median age, 61 years [range of medians, 52-68 years]; 3560 [33%] were women) participating in 27 trials were included. By 28 days, there were 1407 deaths among 6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths among 4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95]; P =.003 based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. The corresponding summary ORs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P &lt;.001) for tocilizumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36; P =.52) for sarilumab. The summary ORs for the association with mortality compared with usual care or placebo in those receiving corticosteroids were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.61-1.38) for sarilumab. The ORs for the association with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death, compared with usual care or placebo, were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for all IL-6 antagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.34) for sarilumab. Secondary infections by 28 days occurred in 21.9% of patients treated with IL-6 antagonists vs 17.6% of patients treated with usual care or placebo (OR accounting for trial sample sizes, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.

Countries across Asia have imposed these containment measures to varying extents. However, residents in different countries would have a differing degree of compliance to these containment measures potentially due to differences in the level of awareness and motivation in the early phase of pandemic. Objectives In our study, we aimed to describe and correlate the level of knowledge and attitude with the level of compliance with personal hygiene and physical distancing practices among Asian countries in the early phase of pandemic. Methods A multinational cross-sectional study was carried out using electronic surveys between May and June 2020 across 14 geographical areas. Subjects aged 21 years and above were invited to participate through social media, word of mouth and electronic mail. Results Among the 2574 responses obtained, 762 (29.6%) participants were from East Asia and 1812 (70.4%) were from Southeast Asia (SEA). A greater proportion of participants from SEA will practise physical distancing as long as it takes (72.8% vs 60.6%). Having safe distancing practices such as standing more than 1 or 2 m apart (AdjOR 5.09 95% CI (1.08 to 24.01)) or more than 3 or 4 m apart (AdjOR 7.05 95% CI (1.32 to 37.67)), wearing a mask when they had influenza-like symptoms before the COVID-19 pandemic, preferring online news channels such as online news websites/applications (AdjOR 1.73 95% CI (1.21 to 2.49)) and social media (AdjOR 1.68 95% CI (1.13 to 2.50) as sources of obtaining information about COVID-19 and high psychological well-being (AdjOR 1.39 95% CI (1.04 to 1.87)) were independent factors associated with high compliance. Conclusions We found factors associated with high compliance behaviour against COVID-19 in the early phase of pandemic and it will be useful to consider them in risk assessment, communication and pandemic preparedness. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

This study aimed to explore the public perception of the MCO implementation and people’s experiences during this period. The study employed qualitative explorative in-depth interviews conducted with 23 Malaysian adults from various demographic backgrounds. Thematic analysis was performed using NVivo 12. Three main themes were identified: a period of information surge, heterogeneous emotional response, and attempts to adapt. During the MCO, the participants obtained information from multiple platforms. They suggested the need for clear and repeated instructions to avoid confusion and misinformation. They also acknowledged the importance of the MCO in breaking the chain of transmission and safeguarding high-risk groups; however, they also expressed that stricter enforcement from the authorities was warranted. The changes in the participants’ work–life routines, lack of physical interaction, and uncertainty about their health and the economy due to the MCO negatively impacted their psychological states. Despite these challenges, the participants attempted to adapt to life under the MCO in different ways. The findings imply that during a crisis, the public tends to seek clear and reliable information, experience emotional turmoil, and adapt to changes. The MCO implementation can be improved through an effective communication strategy and efforts to battle misinformation. © 2021 by the authors.

Method: This study was methodological cross-sectional. It was conducted on an Iranian public population from April to July 2020 which was during the COVID-19 pandemic. Construct validity was determined through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with a total of 500 adults recruited via online data gathering. Reliability was checked through the average inter-item correlation (AIC), Cronbach's alpha, and McDonald's omega. Convergent and divergent validity was determined using Fornell and Larcker's approach. Results: The results showed that the Persian version of IES-R had three factors, including intrusion (six items), avoidance (seven items), and hyperarousal (five items), that explained 59.22% of the total variance of the IES-R. The CFA findings indicated that all goodness-of-fit indices confirmed the model fit. The Cronbach's alpha, McDonald's omega, composite reliability (CR), and maximal reliability were excellent, and the three factors have good convergent validity. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated that the Persian version of the IES-R scale is efficient and useful to assess post-traumatic stress disorder among Iran general population in the COVID-19 outbreak. © Copyright © 2021 Sharif Nia, Kaur, Fomani, Rahmatpour, Kaveh, Pahlevan Sharif, Venugopal and Hosseini.","COVID-19 pandemic; impact of events; Iran; psychometric; reliability; validity",

As RT-PCR sometimes is not feasible in developing nations or rural areas, health professionals may use a rapid antigen test (RAT) to lessen the load of diagnosis. However, the efficacy of RAT is yet to be investigated thoroughly. Hence, we tried to evaluate the overall performance of RAT in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Based on our PROSPERO registered protocol (CRD42021231432), we searched online databases (i.e., PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science) and analysed overall pooled specificity and sensitivity of RAT along with study quality, publication bias, heterogeneity and more. The overall pooled specificity and sensitivity of RAT were detected as 99.4% (95% CI: 99.1–99.8; I2 = 90%) and 68.4% (95% CI: 60.8–75.9; I2 = 98%), respectively. In subgroup analyses, nasopharyngeal specimens and symptomatic patient’s samples were more sensitive in RAT, while cycle threshold (Ct) values were found to have an inverse relationship with sensitivity. In the European and American populations, RAT showed better performance. Although the sensitivity of RAT is yet to be improved, it could still be an alternative in places with poor laboratory set up. Nevertheless, the negative samples of RAT can be re-tested using RT-PCR to reduce false negative results. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, there is an urgent need to communicate the biophilic design elements amongst stakeholders, especially the foreign workers, to ensure the project meets the requirement. However, standard project communications management is no longer practical, as the construction industry worldwide has been severely impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Hence, this paper evaluates the biophilic design elements to be communicated and examines the project communications management breakdown relating to the biophilic design elements in the Malaysian construction industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a systematic literature review (SLR), focus group discussion (FGD) and questionnaire survey on 147 foreign workers, this paper found that from 33 biophilic design element items, only 1 item is categorised as highly critical, whereas another 20 items are categorised as critical. In addition, 43 potential communications management breakdown items from a total of 66 items fall under the critical category. The finding suggests that communication breakdown is caused by the language barrier amongst foreign workers from different ethnicities as well as between foreign workers and the supervisors, since face to face communication is limited during the pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to evaluate the PM2.5 concentrations in this country during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and compare them with those during the corresponding period from 2019. We obtained measurements (taken every minute or every 3 minutes) from approximately 1,500 PM2.5 sensors deployed in industrial areas of northern and southern Taiwan for the first quarters (January–March) of both years.

This disease is easily spreadable from one person to another even with minimal contact, even more for the latest mutations that are more deadly than its predecessor. Hence, COVID-19 needs to be diagnosed as early as possible to minimize the risk of spreading among the community. However, the laboratory results on the approved diagnosis method by the World Health Organization, the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test, takes around a day to be processed, where a longer period is observed in the developing countries. Therefore, a fast screening method that is based on existing facilities should be developed to complement this diagnosis test, so that a suspected patient can be isolated in a quarantine center. In line with this motivation, deep learning techniques were explored to provide an automated COVID-19 screening system based on X-ray imaging. This imaging modality is chosen because of its low-cost procedures that are widely available even in many small clinics. A new convolutional neural network (CNN) model is proposed instead of utilizing pre-trained networks of the existing models. The proposed network, Residual-Shuffle-Net, comprises four stacks of the residual-shuffle unit followed by a spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) unit. The architecture of the residual-shuffle unit follows an hourglass design with reduced convolution filter size in the middle layer, where a shuffle operation is performed right after the split branches have been concatenated back. Shuffle operation forces the network to learn multiple sets of features relationship across various channels instead of a set of global features. The SPP unit, which is placed at the end of the network, allows the model to learn multi-scale features that are crucial to distinguish between the COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia cases. The proposed network is benchmarked with 12 other state-of-the-art CNN models that have been designed and tuned specially for COVID-19 detection. The experimental results show that the Residual-Shuffle-Net produced the best performance in terms of accuracy and specificity metrics with 0.97390 and 0.98695, respectively. The model is also considered as a lightweight model with slightly more than 2 million parameters, which makes it suitable for mobile-based applications. For future work, an attention mechanism can be integrated to target certain regions of interest in the X-ray images that are deemed to be more informative for COVID-19 diagnosis. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we examine the feasibility and implications of several phases of Movement Control Order (MCO) and some non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies implemented by Malaysian government in the year 2020 using a mathematical model with SIR-neural network approaches. It is observed that this model is able to mimic the trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic and, Malaysia had succeeded to flatten the infection curve at the end of the Conditional MCO (CMCO) period. However, the signs of 'flattening' with R0 of less than one had been taken as a signal to ease up on some restrictions enforced before. Though the government has made compulsory the use of face masks in public places to control the spread of COVID-19, we observe a contrasting finding from our model with regards to the impacts of wearing mask policies in Malaysia on R0 and the infection curve.

However, uncertainty or unwillingness to receive the vaccine could be a barrier in attaining sufficient vaccine coverage. Therefore, understanding the psychology of the population towards the vaccines against COVID-19 is of paramount importance. Our study was aimed at determining the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine intention in the Saudi Arabian population. A structured questionnaire guided by the ‘Report of the SAGE working group on vaccine hesitancy’ was administered during a span of two months among the general population from all administrative regions of Saudi Arabia, proceeding the launch of the vaccination campaign. In total, 879 out of 1600 subjects responded and completed the survey (response rate 54.9%). About 56 percent of the participants intended to be vaccinated. The predictors of a higher intention to vaccinate included those 50 years of age or older, male subjects, people suffering from systemic disease/s, subjects who were not previously infected with COVID-19, those who follow the updates about COVID-19 vaccines, and adults with a higher level of anxiety about contracting coronavirus (p < 0.05).

However, success depends on peoples' knowledge levels and rates of acceptance. But, previous research on this topic is currently lacking in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study aimed at to investigate Bangladeshi peoples' knowledge, acceptance, and perception of challenges regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Quantitative data were collected using an online survey (n = 1975) and face-to-face interviews (n = 2200) with a pre-tested structured questionnaire. In addition, seven open-ended interviews were conducted with health experts regarding challenges of vaccination. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between explanatory and dependent variables. Effect size was estimated to understand the magnitude of relationship between two variables. Of 4175 respondents, 92.6% knew about COVID-19 vaccines, while only 37.4% believed vaccines to be effective in controlling COVID-19. Nearly 46% of respondents believed that COVID-19 vaccines have side-effects, and 16.4% of respondents believed that side-effects could be life-threatening. Only 60.5% of respondents indicated that they would receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Out of 1650 respondents (39.5%) who did not intend to receive the vaccine, 948 (57.4%) believed that they would be naturally protected. Regressions results indicated that men had higher rates of knowledge regarding the vaccine. In addition, rural respondents demonstrated lower knowledge regarding the vaccine. Furthermore, education had a significant association with knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines. Respondents with university education had more knowledge regarding the vaccine (Odds ratio, OR = 29.99; 95% confidence interval, CI 11.40- 78.90, effect size 1.88; p = 0.01) and correct dosage (OR 27.34; 95% CI 15.25-49.00, effect size 1.83; p = 0.01). However, women (OR 1.16; 95% CI 0.96-1.40, effect size 0.08) and rural (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.07-1.44, effect size 0.12; p = 0.01) respondents were more enthusiastic regarding receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Higher educated respondents showed higher probability of receiving the vaccine. Those who believed in the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine were 11.57 times more interested (OR 11.57; 95% CI 8.92-15.01, effect size 1.35; p = 0.01) in receiving the vaccine. Open-ended interviews identified several challenges toward successful COVID-19 vaccination.

As a result of the virus’s severe medical effects, developing effective vaccinations is vital. Plant-derived metabo-lites have been discovered as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro ) is a target for therapeutic research because of its highly conserved protein sequence. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and molecular docking were used to screen 34 compounds identified from Leucas zeylanica for potential inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro . In addition, prime molecular mechanics–generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) was used to screen the compound dataset using a molecular dynamics simulation. From molecular docking analysis, 26 compounds were capable of interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, while three compounds, namely 11-oxa-dispiro[4.0.4.1]undecan-1-ol (−5.755 kcal/mol), azetidin-2-one 3,3-dimethyl-4-(1-aminoethyl) (−5.39 kcal/mol), and lorazepam, 2TMS derivative (−5.246 kcal/mol), exhibited the highest docking scores. These three ligands were assessed by MM-GBSA, which re-vealed that they bind with the necessary Mpro amino acids in the catalytic groove to cause protein inhibition, including Ser144, Cys145, and His41. The molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the complex rigidity and stability of the docked ligand–Mpro complexes based on the analysis of mean radical variations, root-mean-square fluctuations, solvent-accessible surface area, radius of gyration, and hydrogen bond formation. The study of the postmolecular dynamics confirmation also confirmed that lorazepam, 11-oxa-dispiro[4.0.4.1]undecan-1-ol, and azetidin-2-one-3, 3-dimethyl-4-(1-aminoethyl) interact with similar Mpro binding pockets. The results of our computerized drug design approach may assist in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. © 2021 by the authors.

The Malaysian government has planned to procure COVID-19 vaccine through multiple agencies and companies in order to vaccinate at least 70% of the population. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, acceptance and perception of Malaysian adults regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Methodology An online survey was conducted for two weeks in December 2020. A bilingual, semi-structured questionnaire was set up using Google Forms and the generated link was shared on social media (i.e., Facebook and WhatsApp). The questionnaire consisted of questions on knowledge, acceptance and perception of COVID-19 vaccine. The association between demographic factors with scores on knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test for two categorical variables, and the Kruskal-Wallis test used for more than two categorical variables. Results A total of 1406 respondents participated, with the mean age of 37.07 years (SD = 16.05) years, and among them 926 (65.9%) were female. Sixty two percent of respondents had poor knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine (mean knowledge score 4.65; SD = 2.32) and 64.5% were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. High knowledge scores associated with higher education background, higher-income category and living with who is at higher risk of getting severe COVID-19. They were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they were in a lower age group, have higher education levels and were female. Conclusion Even though knowledge about vaccine COVID-19 is inadequate, the majority of the respondents were willing to get vaccinated. This finding can help the Ministry of Health plan for future efforts to increase vaccine uptake that may eventually lead to herd immunity against COVID-19. © 2021 Mohamed et al.

Educational institutions around the world have stressed online learning programs in the aftermath of the pandemic. However, because of insufficient access to Information Communication Technology (ICT), a substantial number of students failed to harness the opportunity of online learning. This study explores the latent digital divide exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic while online learning activities are emphasised among students of Bangladesh. It also investigates the digital divide exposure and the significant underlying drivers of the divide. In order to accomplish this, a cross-sectional survey was employed to collect quantitative data, mixed with open-ended questions were utilised to gather qualitative information from the student community. The findings revealed that despite the majority of students having physical access to ICT, only 32.5% of students could attend online classes seamlessly. In total, 34.1% reported data prices as the critical barrier, while 39.8% identified poor network infrastructure as the significant barrier preventing them from participating in online learning activities. Although most students possess physical access to various devices and the Internet, they face the first-level digital divide due to the quality of access and price of cellular Internet. Consequently, they fail to take advantage of physical access, resulting in the third-level digital divide (utility gap), which submerges them into a digital divide cycle. The primary objective of this study is to explore the underlying issues of the digital divide among Bangladeshi students. This will assist relevant stakeholders (e.g., the Bangladesh government, educational institutions, and researchers) to gain necessary insights and theoretical understanding of underlying limitations and emergent directions to arrange adequate support for underprivileged students to undertake essential online learning activities. © 2021 by the authors.","COVID-19; Digital divide; Multi-level digital divide; Online learning","Digital devices; Economic and social effects; Students; Cross-sectional surveys; Educational institutions; Information communication technology; Network infrastructure; Online learning activities; Open-ended questions; Qualitative information; Quantitative data; E-learning"

Globally, it was observed that countries implementing strict movement control were more successful in controlling the spread of the virus as compared with those with less stringent measures. Society’s adherence to the movement control order has helped expedite the process to flatten the pandemic curve as seen in countries such as China and Malaysia. At the same time, there are countries facing challenges with society’s nonconformity toward movement restriction orders due to various claims such as human rights violations as well as sociocultural and economic issues. In Indonesia, society’s adherence to its large-scale social restrictions (LSSRs) order is also a challenge to achieve. Indonesia is regarded as among the worst in Southeast Asian countries in terms of managing the spread of COVID-19. It is proven by the increased number of daily confirmed cases and the total number of deaths, which was more than 6.21% (1351/21,745) of total active cases as of May 2020. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore public sentiments and emotions toward the LSSR and identify issues, fear, and reluctance to observe this restriction among the Indonesian public. Methods: This study adopts a sentiment analysis method with a supervised machine learning approach on COVID-19-related posts on selected media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube). The analysis was also performed on COVID-19-related news contained in more than 500 online news platforms recognized by the Indonesian Press Council. Social media posts and news originating from Indonesian online media between March 31 and May 31, 2020, were analyzed. Emotion analysis on Twitter platform was also performed to identify collective public emotions toward the LSSR. Results: The study found that positive sentiment surpasses other sentiment categories by 51.84% (n=1,002,947) of the total data (N=1,934,596) collected via the search engine. Negative sentiment was recorded at 35.51% (686,892/1,934,596) and neutral sentiment at 12.65% (244,757/1,934,596). The analysis of Twitter posts also showed that the majority of public have the emotion of “trust” toward the LSSR. Conclusions: Public sentiment toward the LSSR appeared to be positive despite doubts on government consistency in executing the LSSR. The emotion analysis also concluded that the majority of people believe in LSSR as the best method to break the chain of COVID-19 transmission. Overall, Indonesians showed trust and expressed hope toward the government’s ability to manage this current global health crisis and win against COVID-19. ©Andi Muhammad Tri Sakti, Emma Mohamad, Arina Anis Azlan.","COVID-19; Infodemiology; Infoveillance; Large-scale social restrictions; Public sentiment; Social media; Twitter","anger; anticipation; Article; big data; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; data mining; disgust; emotion; fear; feature selection; happiness; human; Indonesia; Indonesian; large scale social restriction; lockdown; major clinical study; public opinion; quarantine; sadness; social isolation; social media; supervised machine learning; trust; word processing"

Good leadership image in times of a health emergency is paramount to ensure public confidence in governments’ abilities to manage the crisis. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify types of image repair strategies utilized by the Malaysian government in their communication about COVID-19 in the media and analyze public responses to these messages on social media. Methods: Content analysis was employed to analyze 120 media statements and 382 comments retrieved from Facebook pages of 2 mainstream newspapers—Berita Harian and The Star. These media statements and comments were collected within a span of 6 weeks prior to and during the first implementation of Movement Control Order by the Malaysian Government. The media statements were analyzed according to Image Repair Theory to categorize strategies employed in government communications related to COVID-19 crisis. Public opinion responses were measured using modified lexicon-based sentiment analysis to categorize positive, negative, and neutral statements. Results: The Malaysian government employed all 5 Image Repair Theory strategies in their communications in both newspapers. The strategy most utilized was reducing offensiveness (75/120, 62.5%), followed by corrective action (30/120, 25.0%), evading responsibilities (10/120, 8.3%), denial (4/120, 3.3%), and mortification (1/120, 0.8%). This study also found multiple substrategies in government media statements including denial, shifting blame, provocation, defeasibility, accident, good intention, bolstering, minimization, differentiation, transcendence, attacking accuser, resolve problem, prevent recurrence, admit wrongdoing, and apologize. This study also found that 64.7% of public opinion was positive in response to media statements made by the Malaysian government and also revealed a significant positive association (P=.04) between image repair strategies utilized by the Malaysian government and public opinion. Conclusions: Communication in the media may assist the government in fostering positive support from the public. Suitable image repair strategies could garner positive public responses and help build trust in times of crisis. ©Nasaai Masngut, Emma Mohamad.","Communication; Content analysis; COVID-19; Crisis; Health communication; Image repair; Malaysian government; Public opinion; Sentiment; Social media; Strategy",

Due to strict lockdown measures, many countries experienced economic downturns, negatively affecting many industries including energy, manufacturing, agricul-ture, finance, healthcare, food, education, tourism, and sports. Despite this, the COVID-19 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to observe the impacts of worldwide lockdown on global carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions and climate change. Being the main greenhouse gas responsible for rising global surface temperature, CO2 is released to the atmosphere primarily by burning fossil fuels. Compared to 2019, CO2 emissions for the world and Malaysia decreased significantly by 4.02% (−1365.83 MtCO2 ) and 9.7% (−225.97 MtCO2 ) in 2020.

Left unchecked, these emotional changes might have a wide array of adverse impacts. To reduce negative emotions and increase positive emotions, we tested the effectiveness of reappraisal, an emotion-regulation strategy that modifies how one thinks about a situation. Participants from 87 countries and regions (n = 21,644) were randomly assigned to one of two brief reappraisal interventions (reconstrual or repurposing) or one of two control conditions (active or passive). Results revealed that both reappraisal interventions (vesus both control conditions) consistently reduced negative emotions and increased positive emotions across different measures. Reconstrual and repurposing interventions had similar effects. Importantly, planned exploratory analyses indicated that reappraisal interventions did not reduce intentions to practice preventive health behaviours. The findings demonstrate the viability of creating scalable, low-cost interventions for use around the world.

Based on historical archives, the first coronavirus-related disease rec-orded was possibly animal-related, a case of feline infectious peritonitis described as early as 1912. Despite over a century of documented coronaviruses in animals, the global animal industry still suffers from outbreaks. Knowledge and experience handling animal coronaviruses provide a valuable tool to complement our understanding of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we present an overview of coronaviruses, clinical signs, COVID-19 in animals, genome organization and recombination, immunopathogenesis, transmission, viral shedding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. By drawing parallels between COVID-19 in animals and humans, we provide perspectives on the pathophysiological mechanisms by which coronaviruses cause diseases in both animals and humans, providing a critical basis for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against these deadly viruses. © 2021 by the authors.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) require adequate protection to avoid onward transmission and minimize burden on the healthcare system. Moreover, HCWs can also influence the general public into accepting the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, determining COVID-19 vaccine intention among HCWs is of paramount importance to plan tailor-made public health strategies to maximize vaccine coverage. A structured questionnaire was administered in February and March 2021 among HCWs in Saudi Arabia using convenience sampling, proceeding the launch of the vaccination campaign. HCWs from all administrative regions of Saudi Arabia were included in the study. In total, 674 out of 1124 HCWs responded and completed the survey (response rate 59.9%). About 65 percent of the HCWs intended to get vaccinated. The intention to vaccinate was significantly higher among HCWs 50 years of age or older, Saudi nationals and those who followed the updates about COVID-19 vaccines (p < 0.05). The high percentage (26 percent) of those who were undecided in getting vaccinated is a positive sign. As the vaccination campaign gathers pace, the attitude is expected to change over time.

Various advanced medical imaging and machine learning techniques have been presented to detect these respiratory disorders accurately. In this work, we have proposed a novel COVID-19 detection system using an exemplar and hybrid fused deep feature generator with X-ray images. The proposed Exemplar COVID-19FclNet9 comprises three basic steps: exemplar deep feature generation, iterative feature selection and classification. The novelty of this work is the feature extraction using three pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the presented feature extraction phase. The common aspects of these pre-trained CNNs are that they have three fully connected layers, and these networks are AlexNet, VGG16 and VGG19. The fully connected layer of these networks is used to generate deep features using an exemplar structure, and a nine-feature generation method is obtained. The loss values of these feature extractors are computed, and the best three extractors are selected. The features of the top three fully connected features are merged. An iterative selector is used to select the most informative features. The chosen features are classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed COVID-19FclNet9 applied nine deep feature extraction methods by using three deep networks together. The most appropriate deep feature generation model selection and iterative feature selection have been employed to utilise their advantages together. By using these techniques, the image classification ability of the used three deep networks has been improved. The presented model is developed using four X-ray image corpora (DB1, DB2, DB3 and DB4) with two, three and four classes. The proposed Exemplar COVID-19FclNet9 achieved a classification accuracy of 97.60%, 89.96%, 98.84% and 99.64% using the SVM classifier with 10-fold cross-validation for four datasets, respectively. Our developed Exemplar COVID-19FclNet9 model has achieved high classification accuracy for all four databases and may be deployed for clinical application. © 2021 by the authors.

The remarkable increase in the global usage of face masks, which mainly contain polypropylene, and improper waste management have led to a serious environmental challenge called microplastic pollution. Potential practices for waste management related to waste valorization of discarded face masks as the major type of waste during the COVID-19 pandemic are explored in this study. Recommendations based on governmental practices, situation of state facilities, and societal awareness and engagement applicable to emergency (including COVID-19 pandemic) and postpandemic scenarios are offered while considering potential solutions and available waste management practices in different countries during emergency conditions.

Despite this belief, whether HE produces certificates/qualifications or job-ready graduates—this debate remains unsettled. To date, the current COVID-19 pandemic which erupted in late 2019 continues to create much economic, social and political dislocation throughout the world. Consequently, one outcome for HE during this crisis is the much greater dependence on online/digital technology to deliver courses and programs. Although it is not considered to be a complete substitute, critics argue that education delivered through online technology has expended the ‘diploma disease’ crisis and subsequently may pose a threat to the viability of producing HE graduates. It has been suggested that this can result in significant long-term problems that may be impossible to recover from. This study was based on a ‘empirical survey’ where the sample incorporated 240 people in two groups (before and during COVID-19, for a total of 120 in each), and the objective was to examine academic and job-readiness of graduates in greater depth. Findings demonstrate that pre-pandemic students scored poorly academically compared to their post-pandemic classmates. Pre-pandemic graduates, on the other hand, had higher work readiness scores in terms of both aptitude and practical aspects. Furthermore, both groups outperformed their job-readiness scores in terms of learning performance. This raises the question: is it the job of higher education to promote sustainable production of graduates or deliver certificates and degrees? COVID-19 appears to have been utilised by the HE system as an excuse to exacerbate the “diploma disease crisis,” a scenario that must be resolved by developing a proper policy framework that allows HE to play the necessary role in an emergency. Meaningful measures should be taken so that online technology is employed properly in this situation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Diploma disease; Industry and higher education collaboration; Online technology; Sustainable higher education","Empirical surveys; Higher education; Job readiness; Learning performance; Long-term problems; Online technology; Policy framework; Sustainable production; Education; comparative study; COVID-19; disease; educational development; higher education; industry; Internet; learning; sustainability; Bangladesh"

The recent circular economy (CE) practices have brought a new shape for the waste management industry, creating value from the generated waste. The shift to a CE represents one of the most significant challenges, particularly in sorting and classifying generated waste. Addressing these challenges would facilitate the recycling industry and helps in promoting remanufacturing. But in the COVID times, most of the generated waste is getting mixed with conventional waste types, especially in the global south. The pandemic has resulted in colossal infectious waste generation. Its handling became the most significant challenge raising fears and concerns over sorting and classifying. Hence, this study proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based automated solution for sorting COVID related medical waste streams from other waste types and, at the same time, ensures data-driven decisions for recycling in the context of CE. Metal, paper, glass waste categories, including the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste from the pandemic, are considered. The waste type classification is done based on the image-texture-dependent features, which provided an accurate sorting and classification before the recycling process starts. The features are fused using the proposed decision-level feature fusion scheme. The classification model based on the support vector machine (SVM) classifier performs best (with 96.5 % accuracy, 95.3 % sensitivity, and 95.9 % specificity) in classifying waste types in the context of circular manufacturing and exhibiting the abilities to manage the COVID related medical waste mixed. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","COVID waste management; Feature fusion; Machine learning; Medical waste streams; Smart circular economy; Waste sorting","Data streams; Image texture; Industrial economics; Plastic bottles; Plastic recycling; Sorting; Support vector machines; Textures; Automated solutions; Classification models; Continuous process; Data driven decision; Environmental safety; Polyethylene terephthalates (PET); Recycling industry; Type classifications; Waste management"

Both direct and indirect consequences from COVID-19 infection are recognized to give rise to cardio- and cerebrovascular complications. Despite current limited knowledge on COVID-19 pathogenesis, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulopathy appear to play critical roles in COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular disease (CVD). One of the major subtypes of CVD is cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) which represents a spectrum of pathological processes of various etiologies affecting the brain microcirculation that can trigger subsequent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Prevalent with aging, CSVD is a recognized risk factor for stroke, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. In the background of COVID-19 infection, the heightened cellular activations from inflammations and oxidative stress may result in elevated levels of microthrombogenic extracellular-derived circulating microparticles (MPs). Consequently, MPs could act as pro-coagulant risk factor that may serve as microthrombi for the vulnerable microcirculation in the brain leading to CSVD manifestations. This review aims to appraise the accumulating body of evidence on the plausible impact of COVID-19 infection on the formation of microthrombogenic MPs that could lead to microthrombosis in CSVD manifestations, including occult CSVD which may last well beyond the pandemic era. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cerebral small vessel disease; Coagulopathy; COVID-19; Microparticles; Stroke","aging; Alzheimer disease; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; human; microcirculation; multiinfarct dementia; nerve degeneration; nervous system inflammation; Review; risk factor; virology; cerebrovascular disease; complication; diagnostic imaging; membrane microparticle; metabolism; pathology; physiology; risk factor; thrombosis; Cell-Derived Microparticles; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; COVID-19; Humans; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Thrombosis"

If COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, why is COPD not the leading risk factor for contracting COVID-19? The same odd phenomenon was also observed with other pathogenic human coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but not other respiratory viral infections such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. One commonly proposed reason for the low COPD rates among COVID-19 patients is the usage of inhaled corticosteroids or bronchodilators that may protect against COVID-19. However, another possible reason not discussed elsewhere is that lungs in a diseased state may not be conducive for the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to establish COVID-19. For one, COPD causes mucous plugging in large and small airways, which may hinder SARS-CoV-2 from reaching deeper parts of the lungs (i.e., alveoli). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may only localize to the upper respiratory tract of persons with COPD, causing mild or asymptomatic infections requiring no hospital attention. Even if SARS-CoV-2 reaches the alveoli, cells therein are probably under a heavy burden of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and extensively damaged where it may not support efficient viral replication. As a result, limited SARS-CoV-2 virions would be produced in diseased lungs, preventing the development of COVID-19. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COVID-19; Epidemiology, diseased cell; Respiratory infection; SARS-CoV-2","chronic obstructive lung disease; complication; human; lung; prevalence; COVID-19; Humans; Lung; Prevalence; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; SARS-CoV-2"

Genome comparisons have shown that previous isolates, the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), including the SARS-CoV are closely related, yet different in disease manifestation. Several explanations were suggested for the undetermined origin of SARS-CoV-2, in particular, bats, avian and Malayan pangolins as reservoir hosts, owing to the high genetic similarity. The general morphology and structure of all these viral isolates overlap with analogous disease symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnoea and headache, very similar to the current SARS-CoV-2. Chest CT scans for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reveal pulmonary lesions, bilateral ground-glass opacities, and segmental consolidation in the lungs, a common pathological trait. With greatly overlapping similarities among the previous coronavirus, the SARS-CoV, it becomes interesting to observe marked differences in disease severity of the SARS-CoV-2 thereby imparting it the ability to rapidly transmit, exhibit greater stability, bypass innate host defences, and increasingly adapt to their new host thereby resulting in the current pandemic. The most recent B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants of SARS-CoV-2, highlight the fact that changes in amino acids in the Spike protein can contribute to enhanced infection and transmission efficiency.

By utilizing convalescent plasma derived exosomes (CPExo) from COVID-19 recovered persistence could accelerate the treatment strategies in the current state of affairs. Adequate literature has shown that administering the exosome to the in vivo system could be beneficial and could target the pathogens in an effective and precise manner. In this hypothesis we highlight the CPExo instead of convalescent plasma (CP), perhaps to dispense of exosomes are gratified and it's more effectively acquired immune response conferral through antibodies. COVID-19 convalescent plasma has billions of exosomes and it has aptitudes to carry molecular constituents like proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA, etc. Moreover, exosomes are capable of recognizing antigens with adequate sensitivity and specificity. Many of these derivatives could trigger an immune modulation into the cells and act as an epigenetic inheritor response to target pathogens through RNAs. COIVID-19 resistance activated plasma-derived exosomes are either responsible for the effects of plasma beyond the contained immune antibodies or could be inhibitory. The proposed hypothesis suggests that preselecting the plasma-derived antibodies and RNAs merged exosomes would be an optimized therapeutic tactic for COVID-19 patients.

Speedy expansion, ways and procedures for the pandemic control require early understanding when solutions with better computer-based mathematical modeling and prognosis are developed. Despite high uncertainty in each of these models, one of the important tools for public health management system is epidemiology models. The fractional order is shown to be more effective in modeling epidemic diseases, in relation to the memory effects. Notably, recently founded calculus tools, called fractal-fractional calculus, having a fractional order and fractal dimension, enable us to study the behavior of a real-world problem under both fractal and fractional tools. This paper is about the dynamical behavior of a new mathematical model of novel corona disease (COVID-19) under the fractal-fractional Atangana-Baleanu derivative. The considered model has three compartments, namely, susceptible, infected and recovered or removed (SIR). The existence and uniqueness of the model's solution will be proved via Krasnoselskii's and Banach's fixed point theorems, respectively. The stability of the solution in the sense of Hyers-Ulam (HU) will be built up by nonlinear functional analysis. Moreover, the numerical simulations for different values of isolation parameters corresponding to various fractal-fractional orders are analyzed using fractional Adams-Bashforth (AB) method with two-step Lagrange polynomial. Finally, the obtained simulation results are applied to the real data of disease spread from Pakistan. The graphical interpretations demonstrate that increasing the isolation parameters which is caused by strict precautionary measures will reduce the disease infection transmission in society. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Coronavirus Pandemic Disease; Existence Theory; Fractal-Fractional Atangana-Baleanu Derivative; Fractional Adams-Bashforth (AB) Method; HU Stability; Numerical Simulation","Calculations; Diagnosis; Dynamic models; Epidemiology; Fixed point arithmetic; Functional analysis; Numerical methods; Existence and uniqueness; Fractional derivatives; Graphical interpretations; Health management systems; Infection transmission; New mathematical model; Nonlinear functional analysis; Precautionary measures; Fractal dimension"

So far, there is no approved treatment available to control this public health issue; however, a few antiviral agents and repurposed drugs support the patients under medical supervision by compromising their adverse effects, especially in emergency conditions. Only a few vaccines have been approved to date. In this context, several plant natural products-based research studies are evidenced to play a crucial role in immunomodulation that can prevent the chances of infection as well as combat the cytokine release storm (CRS) generated during COVID-19 infection. In this present review, we have focused on flavonoids, especially epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, hesperidin, naringenin, quercetin, rutin, luteolin, baicalin, diosmin, ge nistein, biochanin A, and silymarin, which can counteract the virus-mediated elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines leading to multiple organ failure.

Currently, our facility uses the pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) bronchodilator with Venturi mask modified spacer (VMMS) in patients visiting the Emergency Department (ED) for mild to moderate exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We sought to assess the outcomes and acceptance of pMDI-VMMS in the outpatient ED of a tertiary hospital in Malaysia. Methods: We analysed the total visits and discharge rates during periods of using the nebulizer and current pMDI-VMMS methods. The acceptance of pMDI-VMMS by patients and assistant medical officers (AMOs) were assessed by questionnaire. Results and discussion: We analysed 3184 ED visits and responses from 103 patients and 32 AMOs. The direct discharge rate was similar for both nebulizer (n = 2162, 92.5%) and pMDI-VMMS method (n = 768, 90.7%) (p-value = 0.120). Twenty-eight patients (27.2%) favoured the pMDI-VMMS over the nebulizer, whereas 36 patients (35.0%) had no preference for either method. Sixty-four patients (62.1%) felt that the current pMDI-VMMS method was better or at least as effective in relieving their symptoms as a nebulizer. The current method was favoured over the nebulizer by twenty-seven AMOs (84.4%). Twenty-eight (87.5%) AMOs suggested that the current method was more effective than the nebulizer. What is new and conclusion: The bronchodilator delivered via pMDI-VMMS appeared to be comparable to nebulizer in treating mild to moderate asthma and COPD exacerbations in the outpatient ED. Most patients and AMOs accepted the use of pMDI-VMMS in the outpatient ED during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, and medRxiv (preprint repository) databases (up to 7 January 2021). Pooled effect sizes with 95% confidence interval (CI) were generated using random-effects and inverse variance heterogeneity models. The risk of bias of the included RCTs was appraised using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Results: Six RCTs were included: two trials with an overall low risk of bias and four trials had some concerns regarding the overall risk of bias. Our meta-analysis did not find significant mortality benefits with the use of tocilizumab among patients with COVID-19 relative to non-use of tocilizumab (pooled hazard ratio = 0.83; 95% CI 0.66–1.05, n = 2,057). Interestingly, the estimated effect of tocilizumab on the composite endpoint of requirement for mechanical ventilation and/or all-cause mortality indicated clinical benefits, with some evidence against our model hypothesis of no significant effect at the current sample size (pooled hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% CI 0.42–0.91, n = 749).

Here, we examined the extent to which being outdoors (vs. indoors), the experience of loneliness, and screen-time are associated with emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic using an experiencing sampling method. In April 2020, Austrian adults (N = 286, age M = 31.0 years) completed a 21-day experience sampling phase in which they reported their emotional well-being (i.e., happiness), whether they were indoors or outdoors, and loneliness at three random time-points each day, as well as their daily screen-time. Results indicated that being outdoors was associated with higher emotional well-being, whereas greater loneliness and greater daily screen-time were associated with poorer well-being. Additionally, the impact of loneliness on well-being was weaker when participants were outdoors than indoors.

This study aimed to investigate the evolutionary dynamics and spatiotemporal patterns of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the region. Materials and Methods: A total of 1491 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 10 Southeast Asian countries were downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database on November 17, 2020. The evolutionary relationships were assessed using maximum likelihood (ML) and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, and the phylogenetic clustering was tested using principal component analysis (PCA). The spatial patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread within Southeast Asia were inferred using the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) model. The effective population size (Ne) trajectory was inferred using the Bayesian Skygrid model. Results: Four major clades (including one potentially endemic) were identified based on the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree. Similar clustering was yielded by PCA; the first three PCs explained 46.9% of the total genomic variations among the samples. The time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Southeast Asia were estimated to be November 28, 2019 (September 7, 2019 to January 4, 2020) and 1.446 × 10−3 (1.292 × 10−3 to 1.613 × 10−3) substitutions per site per year, respectively. Singapore and Thailand were the two most probable root positions, with posterior probabilities of 0.549 and 0.413, respectively. There were high-support transmission links (Bayes factors exceeding 1,000) in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia; Malaysia involved the highest number (7) of inferred transmission links within the region. A twice-accelerated viral population expansion, followed by a temporary setback, was inferred during the early stages of the pandemic in Southeast Asia. Conclusions: With available genomic data, we illustrate the phylogeography and phylodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Southeast Asia. Continuous genomic surveillance and enhanced strategic collaboration should be listed as priorities to curb the pandemic, especially for regional communities dominated by developing countries. © Copyright © 2021 Zhu, Shen, Zeng, Tan, Kleepbua, Chew, Law, Chew, Tangathajinda, Latthitham and Li.","Bayesian inference; effective population size (Ne); phylodynamics; phylogenetic tree; phylogeography; SARS-CoV-2; Southeast Asia",

Along with the extreme health crisis faced by COVID-19, the education sector was severely impacted. This study explores the perceptions of secondary school teachers of online learning in a program developed in Malaysia during the COVID-19 Pandemic. A quantitative survey was conducted to evaluate teachers' perceptions of teaching and learning engagement. Data have been obtained by a questionnaire. Learning materials used in university student education are also accessible online. The nature of the new technology interweaves formal and informal learning such that students can participate actively in the use of ICT to learn. Otherwise, the teachers will come to a halt a handful of students behind their students, partially because their particular learning style has not been triggered without understanding these various learning methods. Consequently, this survey explored the teachers' understanding of teaching and their relationship with their engagement to learning. Broadly, the success of online learning in Malaysia during the COVID-19 Pandemic was determined by the readiness of technology in line with the national humanist curriculum, support and collaboration from all stakeholders, including government, schools, teachers, parents and the community. The findings indicate that students have a good sense of teaching and there have been strong correlations between the teacher's perceptions and students' engagement to learning. Teachers are recommended to consider the nature of the student and to apply appropriate types of learning tools during their classes. © 2021 Little Lion Scientific.

In Malaysia, various Covid-19 clusters were associated with religious gatherings. From a cultural psychology perspective, how ethno-religious groups respond to this crisis originating from their unique rationality and ecological systems. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the illness perceptions of major religious groups (Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist) in Malaysia toward the Covid-19 pandemic, their stress levels, and the relationship between illness perception, stress, and forms of religious expression during the lockdown period. Through an online survey method, 608 Malaysian religious believers were included in this mixed-method empirical study, which adapted standardized instruments [Duke University Religion Index (DUREL), Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)]. Statistical analysis showed that all three groups reported moderate levels of stress in average without any significant difference after controlling for age. Both internal and external forms of religious expression had a significant negative relationship with stress levels. Personal control, comprehension, and emotions domains of illness perception accounted for a significant variance in the stress level. Furthermore, religious expression significantly moderated the relationship between some illness perception domains and stress. Qualitative coding revealed that most participants perceived human behavior and attitudes, sociopolitical, and sociological factors as causal factors to the current pandemic. These findings confirmed the relationship between religious expression, illness belief, and stress regulation during the pandemic lockdown. Incidental findings of age as a potential protective factor for Malaysian believers warrants further study. In the conclusion, implications for public health policymakers and religious communities on pandemic prevention and well-being promotion were discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Ting, Aw Yong, Tan and Yap.","Covid-19; culture; illness perception; religions; religious expression; stress",

The pandemic disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2, which is the main cause of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Risk assessment is a vital action toward disease risk reduction as it increases the understanding of the risk factors associated with the disease and allows existing data to decide on adequate preventive and mitigation measures. Machine learning techniques have gained strength since 2000, as it has crucial role in data analysis and is really helpful to develop standard mortality models. This study aims to find the best model for data analysis using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and other risk factors, which contribute to the high mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19 in Iran, to predict the risk of death for the people with different situation. A systematic review and meta-analysis were examined by using patient risk factor data from studies done by researchers to estimate COVID-19 death risk. Risk factors for the disease were extracted from an existing study. Using ANN, the best risk prediction for the disease is calculated. Assessment of a different number of hidden neurons with a different training function using the Bayesian Regularization algorithm, the best training function for the ANN model with 5 hidden neurons is found to have the most satisfying results. The coefficient of determination (R) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 9.99999e-1 and 4.54201e-19 respectively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data handling; Diseases; Factor analysis; Information analysis; Learning systems; Mean square error; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Bayesian regularization algorithms; Coefficient of determination; Machine learning techniques; Mitigation measures; Number of hidden neurons; Root mean square errors; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Training function; Neural networks"

Hand hygiene, social distancing, and the usage of personal protective equipment are considered the most vital tools in controlling the primary transmission of the virus. Converging evidence indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and its persistence over several days, which may create secondary transmission of the virus via waterborne and wastewater pathways. Although, researchers have started focusing on this mode of virus transmission, limited knowledge and societal unawareness of the transmission through wastewater may lead to significant increases in the number of positive cases. To emphasize the severe issue of virus transmission through wastewater and create societal awareness, we present a state of the art critical review on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the potential remedial strategies to effectively control the viral spread and safeguard society. For low-income countries with high population densities, it is suggested to identify the virus in large scale municipal wastewater plants before following up with one-to-one testing for effective control of the secondary transmission. Ultrafiltration is an effective method for wastewater treatment and usually more than 4 logs of virus removal are achieved while safeguarding good protein permeability. Decentralized wastewater treatment facilities using solar-assisted disinfestation methods are most economical and can be effectively used in hospitals, isolation wards, and medical centers for reducing the risk of transmission from high local concentration sites, especially in tropical countries with abundant solar energy. Disinfection with chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, and peracetic acid have shown potential in terms of virucidal properties. Biological wastewater treatment using micro-algae will be highly effective in removal of virus and can be incorporated into membrane bio-reaction to achieve excellent virus removal rate. Though promising results have been shown by initial research for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using physical, chemical and biological based treatment methods, there is a pressing need for extensive investigation of COVID-19 specific disinfectants with appropriate concentrations, their environmental implications, and regular monitoring of transmission. Effective wastewater treatment methods with high virus removal capacity and low treatment costs should be selected to control the virus spread and safeguard society from this deadly virus. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Disinfectants; Secondary transmission; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment","benzalkonium; benzalkonium chloride; chlorine; hypochlorite sodium; peracetic acid; virus RNA; COVID-19; disease transmission; membrane; protein; public health; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus; wastewater treatment; aerosol transmission; climate; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 testing; droplet transmission; human; infection control; infection risk; membrane technology; microalga; municipal wastewater; nonhuman; ozonation; quantitative analysis; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distancing; solar energy; tropics; ultrafiltration; virus detection; virus inactivation; virus particle; virus transmission; waste water management; wastewater; water disinfection; pandemic; wastewater; water management; SARS coronavirus; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Waste Water; Water Purification"

It has also led to many environmental ones. For instance, the lockdowns have led to higher levels of consumption of packaged products, and of take-away food. This paper reports on an international study on the increased consumption and subsequent changes in the amounts of waste produced since the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that 45–48% of the respondents observed an increased consumption of packed food, fresh food, and food delivery. One of the main reasons for the increased waste generation during the lockdown was the fact that people have spent more time at home. In addition, increases of 43% and 53% in food waste and plastic packaging. Drawing from comparisons on the amount of domestic waste produced before and during the pandemic, the findings suggest that some specific types of municipal waste have visibly increased, putting additional pressure on waste management systems. This characterises one of non-intended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from this study provide useful insights to city administrations and municipal utilities on consumption patterns during emergency situations. This, in turn, may support more systemic and strategic measures to be taken, so as to curtail the increase of household waste during pandemic situations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Households waste; International wide; Waste generation; Waste management","Food waste; Consumption patterns; Economic problems; Emergency situation; International studies; Municipal utility; Packaged products; Plastic packaging; Waste management systems; Waste management; plastic; COVID-19; domestic waste; municipal solid waste; trend analysis; waste disposal; waste management; Article; catering service; controlled study; convenience food; coronavirus disease 2019; domestic waste; food intake; food packaging; food waste; hospital waste; lockdown; municipal waste; pandemic; plastic waste; trend study; waste management; whole food; city; communicable disease control; food; human; waste disposal; waste management; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Food; Humans; Pandemics; Refuse Disposal; SARS-CoV-2; Waste Management"

Although many countries have actively implemented vaccination strategies to curb the epidemic, there is no specific efficient therapeutic drug for this virus to effectively reduce deaths. Therefore, the underappreciated macromolecular compounds have become the spotlight of research. Furthermore, the medicinal compounds in plants that provide myriad possibilities to treat human diseases have become of utmost importance. Experience indicates that Traditional Chinese medicine effectively treats SARS and has been used for treating patients with COVID-19 in China. As one of the world’s oldest herbal remedies, licorice is used for treating patients with all stages of COVID-19. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), the main active compound in licorice, has been proven effective in killing the SARS virus. Meanwhile, as a natural plant molecule, GA can also directly target important protein structures of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2.

In Malaysia, the small business sector is most affected by the movement control order (MCO). The MCO has caused the closure of the retail and transport sectors that has sharply curtailed the daily operations of the majority of small entrepreneurs, leading to a loss in income. However, if small business communities make optimal use of digital applications for their business activities, their income will be less affected by the current Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the everyday use of ICT has the potential to create numerous landscape improvement and business continuity, specifically for small and medium entrepreneurs (SMEs). This, in turn, would increase community participation in entrepreneurship. Therefore, it is crucial to study the role of digital marketing in strengthening new business norms among small entrepreneurs during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is also imperative to identify other factors that can help boost digital business. This research examined the relationship between ICT use in empowering rural entrepreneurs during MCO in Malaysia. The study design consisted of a quantitative form for each research instrument using the Google Form online survey. This study's sample was selected using a particular sampling method (purposive sampling) and snowball sampling (snowball sampling) involving 158 small rural entrepreneurs in Penang, Malaysia. The data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 27.0 software. The findings showed that the respondents navigated the Covid-19 pandemic by carrying out business activities on the digital platform and took full advantage of the ICT applications as part of their new business norms. This study can provide input for the government to formulate strategies related to ICT in increasing awareness among rural entrepreneurs. Additionally, the input of this study can offer programs and activities to further enhance the entrepreneurs' skills in using ICT. © 2021 Abdul Rashid et al..

New Teaching and Learning (T&L) online norms have been executed except for specific academic programs and subjects only since 18 March 2020 when the Movement Control Order (MCO) was administered and continued to this day. To guarantee students' continuity of education without online T&L dropout, online face-to-face (Synchronous) or not face-to-face (Asynchronous) is now become the primary approach and method platform with many virtual education applications. Therefore, this research examined students' readiness to follow online teaching and learning and analysed the impact of online T&L on the national education agenda. This study involved 133 students of Diploma in Fisheries, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, for the first semester of 2020-21. Data were obtained through a questionnaire using Google Form and presented to students by sharing links to their WhatsApp group in the final week of study. The questionnaire was adapted from several instruments related to various aspects of online T&L during the COVID-19 pandemic. The outcomes revealed that most students were among Gen-Z with digital literacy background. Thus, it was assisting them having a high level of readiness to face online T&L. In terms of the availability of device infrastructure, internet access, e-Learning, and computers, most (80%) have mastered it. Only (20%) have low proficiency due to limited experience using computers and gadgets due to family constraints and their literacy levels. The research conclusion recommends a consecutive enhancement in curriculum structure flexibility, delivery, evaluation; internet accessibility and digital gap, and self-motivation of students entering the era of the self-regulated learner. Transformation demands the strategic cooperation of various parties in educational institutions, government agencies, the private sector, NGOs, and people's leaders in the interest of the country's advancing education relevant to the era of global technology-oriented education and digital infrastructure. © 2021 Mansor et al..

Despite the obvious negative consequences of the pandemic, many have called for efforts to identify transformative opportunities for sustainable development throughout this disorderly time. In the present paper, we explore such potential opportunities in the context of an interdisciplinary, international research project, which is focusing on sustainable marine management in biosphere reserves and marine parks in Southeast Asia. During a virtual workshop conducted as part of the GCRF (Government’s Global Challenges Research Fund) Blue Communities Project, future scenarios were developed depicting the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on five case study sites. All of these sites are in areas of internationally recognized outstanding ecological value (Taka Bonerate Kepulauan-Selayar Biosphere Reserve, Indonesia; Tun Mustapha Park, Sabah, Malaysia; Palawan Biosphere Reserve, Philippines; North Devon Biosphere Reserve, United Kingdom; Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve, Vietnam). At the macro-level, economies, governance structures, and societal norms are undergoing big changes. At the micro-level, the livelihoods, lifestyles, and backyards of local residents have to adapt. Collaboratively, we explored how COVID-19 posed challenges in our five case study sites, but we also focused on the potential COVID-19-related windows of opportunity for future sustainable development. Opportunities could be identified in all three pillars of sustainable development: the environment, the society, and the economy. Although remarkable similarities can be found across all five sites, we conclude that there cannot be a “one-size-fits-all” solution to turn the tide toward achieving sustainable development. Just as before the pandemic, sustainable development starts with engaging with and understanding local environments, challenges, and situations; building on local knowledge; and developing tailor-made solutions for the communities in situ. © Copyright © 2021 Richter, Avillanosa, Cheung, Goh, Johari, Kay, Maharja, Nguyễn, Pahl, Sugardjito, Sumeldan, van Nguyen, Vu, Wan Mohamad Ariffin and Austen.","coastal communities; COVID-19; scenarios; Southeast Asia; sustainable development; window of opportunity",

SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 3.5 million deaths since late 2019. Mutations in the spike (S) glycoprotein are of particular concern because it harbours the domain which recognises the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and is the target for neutralising antibodies. Mutations in the S protein may induce alterations in the surface spike structures, changing the conformational B-cell epitopes and leading to a potential reduction in vaccine efficacy. Here, we summarise how the more important variants of SARS-CoV-2, which include cluster 5, lineages B.1.1.7 (Alpha variant), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (B.1.1.28/Gamma), B.1.427/B.1.429 (Epsilon), B.1.526 (Iota) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) confer mutations in their respective spike proteins which enhance viral fitness by improving binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and lead to an increase in infectivity and transmission. We further discuss how these spike protein mutations provide resistance against immune responses, either acquired naturally or induced by vaccination.

Disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite were used, yet no scientific evidence is available on its effectiveness to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 on the human body through spraying, although this chemical is effective in the elimination of the virus on inanimate surfaces. Since safety issues are of importance, countries have halted the operation of these tunnels. Available literature has suggested several effective disinfectants against SARSCoV-2, including iodine-based solution, such as povidone-iodine (PVP-I). This report describes the evaluation of the bactericidal activity of PVP-I in comparison to sodium hypochlorite, both in vitro and following spraying under a model tunnel. Two bacteria strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) were used as model microorganisms. The spraying pattern and droplets distribution from the tunnel are also being described and were correlated with the effectiveness of the disinfectant droplets to eliminate the model bacteria. Results showed that 0.5 % v/v PVP-I and 0.5% v/v sodium hypochlorite are bactericidal (&gt; 5 log10 reduction) in vitro. However, sprayed disinfectants did not show similar activity. Bacterial growth was seen in all cloth samples for 0.5% v/v PVP-I and all cloth samples except right shoulder for 0.5 % v/v sodium hypochlorite. Hence, the design of any disinfectant tunnel is important, and with an effective disinfectant to justify its efficacy. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

COVID-19 can be potentially detected by using Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images, as these images contain essential information of lung infection. This radiology image is usually examined by the expert to detect the presence of COVID-19 symptom. In this study, the improved stacked sparse autoencoder is used to examine the radiology images. According to the result, the proposed deep learning model was able to achieve a classification accuracy of 96.6% and 83.0% for chest X-ray and chest CT-scan images, respectively. © 2021, Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among doctors and nurses in the medical department in Pusat Perubatan Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia between November 18, 2020 and December 18, 2020 during the third wave of COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia. We studied the knowledge and practice of preventive measures of COVID-19 among doctors and nurses in the COVID-19 or sudden acute respiratory infection (SARI) wards and general medical wards. Data was collected using a validated self-designed google form online-questionnaire. Results: A total of 407 subjects completed the study and 80.8% were females; 55.8% were aged between 30-39 years; 46.4% were medical doctors. The main source of COVID-19 knowledge was the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH) website (35.1%). Majority (97%) had sufficient knowledge and 82% practiced proper preventive measures. Doctors had a higher mean knowledge score compared to nurses (p < 0.001). HCWs working in COVID-19 or SARI wards scored higher in knowledge questions compared to those in the general medical wards (p = 0.020). Nurses practiced better preventive measures (p < 0.001). Good knowledge could not be predicted based on professions (OR: 0.222, 95% CI: 0.048 – 1.028, p = 0.054). Majority were unable to recall the proper steps of donning (85.8%) and doffing (98.5%). Conclusions: Although majority had good knowledge and practiced proper preventive measures, there was a poor recall in donning and doffing steps regardless of place of practice. The MOH website is a useful platform for tailored continuous medical education and regular updates on COVID-19. Regular training and retraining on donning and doffing of PPE is needed to bridge this gap. © 2021, Malaysian Medical Association.

The treatment focused mainly on repurposed immunomodulatory and antiviral agents along with the availability of a few vaccines for prophylaxis to vanquish COVID-19. This seemingly mandates a deeper understanding of the disease pathogenesis. This necessitates a plausible extrapolation of cell-based therapy to COVID-19 and is regarded equivalently significant. Recently, correlative pieces of clinical evidence reported a robust decline in lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients that suggest dysregulated immune responses as a key element contributing to the pathophysiological alterations. The large granular lymphocytes also known as natural killer (NK) cells play a heterogeneous role in biological functioning wherein their frontline action defends the body against a wide array of infections and tumors. They prominently play a critical role in viral clearance and executing immuno-modulatory activities. Accumulated clinical evidence demonstrate a decrease in the number of NK cells in circulation with or without phenotypical exhaustion. These plausibly contribute to the progression of pulmonary inflammation in COVID-19 pneumonia and result in acute lung injury. In this review, we have outlined the present understanding of the immunological response of NK cells in COVID-19 infection. We have also discussed the possible use of these powerful biological cells as a therapeutic agent in view of preventing immunological harms of SARS-CoV-2 and the current challenges in advocating NK cell therapy for the same. © 2021","COVID-19; Cytokines; Natural killer cells; Pulmonary inflammation; SARS-CoV-2",

Against this backdrop, the purpose of this paper is to examine the application of the Islamic principle of ḥifẓ al-nafs (protection of life) in the practice of worshipping at the Nurul Iman mosque as it relates to the prevention of transmission of covid-19. Methods: This research uses a sociology of law perspective to the connection and the dynamics between the adoption of the principle of ḥifẓ al-nafs and the implementation of worship at the Nurul Iman mosque. As a case study, the data collection technique used includes interviews, observation, documentation reviews, and triangulation techniques, while the analysis technique used content analysis techniques. Results: The application of the principle of ḥifẓ al-nafs (protection of life) in the practices of worship at the Nurul Iman mosque have proven to be in accordance with health protocols and at the same time all members of the mosque congregation have been free from the transmission of covid-19. From an Islamic needs framework perspective, in the context of Covid-19 pandemic, the application of the ḥifẓ al-nafs principle at this mosque is a considered primary necessity (ḍarūriyyāt) in that it protects life while providing spiritual continuity of collective religious worshipping, hence integrating the community together within a health and sanctity of life paradigm during this challenging time. Equally important, this research also challenges the thesis of the direct linkage between worshipping in mosque and Covid-19 transmission. Conclusion: the application of the principle of ḥifẓ al-nafs in the practices of worship in mosque has demonstrably shown that the congragants levels of health consciousness has increased and that they have also been kept safe. In essence, the effective contextualization of Islamic principle is able to provide the twin benefits of health and spirituality. © 2021 The Author(s)","Covid-19; Mosque congregations; Mosque imams; Protection of life; Worship",

The new working environment caused by the pandemic is assumed to have a different impact on the amount of work that women and men can do from home. Particularly, if the major burden of child and other types of care is still predominantly on the shoulders of women. As such, a survey was conducted to assess the main issues that biomedical engineers, medical physicists (academics and professionals), and other similar professionals have been facing when working from home during the pandemic. A survey was created and disseminated worldwide. It originated from a committee of International Union for Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine (IUPESM; Women in Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Task Group) and supported by the Union. The ethics clearance was received from Carleton University. The survey was deployed on the Survey Monkey platform and the results were analyzed using IBM SPSS software. The analyses mainly consisted of frequency of the demographic parameters and the cross-tabulation of gender with all relevant variables describing the impact of work at home. A total of 921 responses from biomedical professions in 76 countries were received: 339 males, 573 females, and nine prefer-not-to-say/other. Regarding marital/partnership status, 85% of males were married or in partnership, and 15% were single, whereas 72% of females were married or in partnership, and 26% were single. More women were working from home during the pandemic (68%) versus 50% of men. More men had access to an office at home (68%) versus 64% for women. The proportion of men spending more than 3 h on child care and schooling per day was 12%, while for women it was 22%; for household duties, 8% of men spent more than 3 h; for women, this was 12.5%. It is interesting to note that 44% of men spent between 1 and 3 h per day on household duties, while for women, it was 55%. The high number of survey responses can be considered excellent. It is interesting to note that men participate in childcare and household duties in a relatively high percentage; although this corresponds to less hours daily than for women. It is far more than can be found 2 and 3 decades ago. This may reflect the situation in the developed countries only—as majority of responses (75%) was received from these countries. It is evident that the burden of childcare and household duties will have a negative impact on the careers of women if the burden is not more similar for both sexes. It is important to recognize that a change in policies of organizations that hire them may be required to provide accommodation and compensation to minimize the negative impact on the professional status and career of men and women who work in STEM fields. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","biomedical engineers; COVID-19 pandemic; gender balance; medical physics; survey; working from home",

Health care workers (HCWs) are vulnerable to this crisis as they are the first frontline to receive and manage COVID-19 patients. In this multicenter multinational survey, we aim to assess the level of awareness and preparedness of hospital staff regarding COVID-19 all over the world. Methods: From February to March 2020, the web-based or paper-based survey to gather information about the hospital staff's awareness and preparedness in the participants' countries will be carried out using a structured questionnaire based on the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) checklist and delivered to participants by the local collaborators for each hospital. As of March 2020, we recruited 374 hospitals from 58 countries that could adhere to this protocol as approved by their Institutional Review Boards (IRB) or Ethics Committees (EC). Discussion: The awareness and preparedness of HCWs against COVID-19 are of utmost importance not only to protect themselves from infection, but also to control the virus transmission in healthcare facilities and to manage the disease, especially in the context of manpower lacking and hospital overload during the pandemic. The results of this survey can be used to inform hospitals about the awareness and preparedness of their health staff regarding COVID-19, so appropriate policies and practice guidelines can be implemented to improve their capabilities of facing this crisis and other future pandemic-prone diseases. © Copyright © 2021 Qarawi, Ng, Gad, Luu, AL-Ahdal, Sharma, Huan, Vuong, Tawfik, Hashan, Dumre, Ghozy, Shaikhkhalil, Mahmoud, Alhady, Nam, Islam, Smith, Lee, Chico, Cox, Hirayama and Huy.","awareness; COVID-19; global survey; hospital staff; preparedness","epidemic; hospital personnel; human; multicenter study (topic); pandemic; United States; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Pandemics; Personnel, Hospital; SARS-CoV-2; United States"

This epidemic has brought a risk of death in the daily activity (physical and social) participation that influences travellers’ physical, social, and mental health. To analyze the impact of the COVID-19-induced daily activities on health parameters of higher education institutes, 150 students of the Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Perak, Malaysia, were surveyed through an online web survey using random sampling techniques. The data were analyzed through RStudio and SPSS using multilevel linear regression analysis and Hierarchical Structural Equation Modeling. The estimated results indicate that restricting individuals from doing out-of-home activities negatively influences physical and social health. A unit increase in the in-home maintenance activities during the COVID-19 pandemic introduced a daily increase of 0.5% in physical health. Moreover, a unit increase in the in-home activities at leisure time represents a 1% positive improvement in social health. Thus, physical activity has proven to be beneficial in improving physical and social health with severe COVID-19.

Since its outbreak, many therapeutics have been tested, including the use of repurposed medications, nucleoside inhibitors, protease inhibitors, broad spectrum antivirals, convalescence plasma therapies, immune-modulators, and monoclonal antibodies. However, these approaches have not yielded any outcomes and are mostly used to alleviate symptoms associated with potentially fatal adverse drug reactions.

However, multilevel thresholding becomes increasingly more computationally complex as the number of thresholds grows. In order to address this defect, this paper proposes a new multilevel thresholding approach based on the Evolutionary Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA). The arithmetic operators in science were the inspiration for AOA. DAOA is the proposed approach, which employs the Differential Evolution technique to enhance the AOA local research. The proposed algorithm is applied to the multilevel thresholding problem, using Kapur’s measure between class variance functions. The suggested DAOA is used to evaluate images, using eight standard test images from two different groups: Nature and CT COVID-19 images. Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index test (SSIM) are standard evaluation measures used to determine the accuracy of segmented images. The proposed DAOA method’s efficiency is evaluated and compared to other multilevel thresholding methods. The findings are presented with a number of different threshold values (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). According to the experimental results, the proposed DAOA process is better and produces higher-quality solutions than other comparative approaches. Moreover, it achieved better-segmented images, PSNR, and SSIM values. In addition, the proposed DAOA is ranked the first method in all test cases. © 2021 by the authors.

However, its prevalence and association with sociodemographic factors and psychological process variables has not been explored in frontline workers under surveillance in a Bornean population. This study was a cross‐sectional study using a sociodemographic questionnaire incorporating two specific epidemiological risk variables, namely specific questions about COVID‐ 19 surveillance status (persons under investigation (PUI), persons under surveillance (PUS), and positive cases) and the nature of frontline worker status. Furthermore, five other instruments were used, with three measuring psychopathology (namely depression, anxiety and stress, fear of COVID‐19, and stress due to COVID‐19) and two psychological process variables (namely psychological flexibility and mindfulness). Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney tests were performed to assess if there were significant differences in psychopathology and psychological process variables between sociodemographic and epidemiological risk variables. Hierarchical multiple regression was further performed, with depression, anxiety, and stress as dependent variables. There were significant differences in the fear of COVID‐19 between positive cases, PUI, and PUS. The fear of COVID‐19 scores were higher in positive cases compared to in PUS and PUI groups. Upon hierarchical multiple regression, mindfulness and psychological flexibility were significant predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress after controlling for sociodemographic and epidemiological risk factors. This study demonstrates that exposure to COVID‐19 as persons under investigation or surveillance significantly increases the fear of COVID‐19, and brief psychological interventions that can positively influence mindfulness and psychological flexibility should be prioritized for these at‐risk groups to prevent undue psychological morbidity in the long run. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: A multi-centre, retrospective observational study was performed among children aged ≤12 years with laboratory-proven COVID-19 between 1 February and 31 December 2020. Results: In total, 261 children (48.7% males, 51.3% females) were included in this study. The median age was 6 years [interquartile range (IQR) 3–10 years]. One hundred and fifty-one children (57.9%) were asymptomatic on presentation. Among the symptomatic cases, fever was the most common presenting symptom. Two hundred and forty-one (92.3%) cases were close contacts of infected household or extended family members. Twenty-one (8.4%) cases had abnormal radiological findings. All cases were discharged alive without requiring supplemental oxygen therapy or any specific treatment during hospitalization. The median duration of hospitalization was 7 days (IQR 6–10 days). One (2.1%) of the uninfected guardians accompanying a child in quarantine tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) upon discharge. Conclusions: COVID-19 in children was associated with mild symptoms and a good prognosis. Familial clustering was an important epidemiologic feature in the outbreak in Negeri Sembilan. The risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children to guardians in hospital isolation was minimal despite close proximity. © 2021 The Authors","Clinical features; Epidemiology; Paediatric COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","Article; asthma; asymptomatic carrier; child; clinical feature; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis software; demography; epidemiological data; extended family; female; fever; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospitalization; household; human; isolation hospital; laboratory test; legal guardian; length of stay; major clinical study; male; morbidity; Negeri Sembilan; observational study; outcome assessment; population distribution; preschool child; quarantine; radiological parameters; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; statistical analysis; study design"

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of physical inactivity and the patterns of physical activity among university students in confinement. This cross-sectional study involved 147 Malaysian students and 107 Indonesian students. Body weight before the pandemic and during the pandemic was self-reported by the respondents, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) was used to assess the physical activity and sedentary behavior of the respondents. The findings revealed that 79.6% of Malaysians and 77.6% of Indonesians were physically active during the confinement. There was no significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in the duration devoted to vigorous-intensity activity (MMalaysian = 0.00 MET minutes/week and MIndonesian = 480.00 MET minutes/week) and moderate-intensity activity (MMalaysian = 0.00 MET minutes/week and MIndonesian = 0.00 MET minutes/week) among the studied population. During the pandemic, Malaysian students (M = 1386.00 MET min-utes/week) devoted a significantly higher duration to walking (M = 1386.00 MET minutes/week) and sedentary behavior (9.16 ± 4.47 h/day) than Indonesian students (M = 990.00 MET min-utes/week and sedentary behavior = 7.85 ± 4.27 h/day). Overall, no significant difference was noted in the total physical activity of Malaysian and Indonesian students during the pandemic (MMalaysian = 2826.00 MET minutes/week and MIndonesian = 1782.00 MET minutes/week). Findings from Spearman’s rank correlation test suggested that there was a weak inverse correlation between the duration engaged in vigorous-intensity activity and weight change among the Malaysian students (rs = −0.199, p = 0.016), after adjusting for gender and age. Overall, the closure of learning institutions and exercise facilities has further prevented individuals from complying with the WHO recommendation of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity during the period of home confinement. © 2021 by the authors.

We conducted a cross-sectional anonymous survey among adults (≥18 years old) in 11 countries (Brazil, Bulgaria, China, India, Ireland, Malaysia, North Macedonia, Sin-gapore, Spain, Turkey, United States). Of 11,775 participants, 63.7% were female and 52.8% were 18–34 years old. More than 40% of participants were insufficiently active (43.9%) and reported a decrease in their PA during lockdown (44.8%). Statistically significant differences were observed in (1) proportions of participants being insufficiently active, (2) level of PA, and (3) decrease in PA across the 11 countries. More stringent governmental policy responses were associated with greater likelihood of being insufficiently active during lockdown (adjusted odds ratio = 1.22, 95% confi-dence interval = 1.03, 1.45). Higher depression or anxiety scores were associated with greater likelihood of decreased level of PA during lockdown. We found substantial reductions in PA levels during COVID-19 lockdown across countries.

COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be spread by symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. As such, determining the risk of infection within a community is dif-ficult. To mitigate the risk of the spread of COVID-19, the government of Malaysia implemented seven phases of the movement control order (MCO) from 18 March to 31 December 2020. However, the socioeconomic cost was substantial despite the effectiveness of the MCO in bringing down cases of infection. As noted by the Prime Minister of Malaysia, the final criterion that should be met is community empowerment. In other words, community-based mitigation measures through which communities unite to contain the pandemic are essential before the completion of the vaccination program. As a measure for controlling the pandemic, mitigation strategies in the new normal should be feasible, practical, and acceptable to communities. In this paper, we present a deliberation of a set of community-based monitoring criteria to ensure health and well-being in communities, such as efficacy, technicality, feedback, and sustainability. The proposed criteria will be instrumental in developing community-based monitoring initiatives to achieve the desired goals in coping with the pandemic as well as in empowering communities to be part of the governance process. © 2021 by the authors.

The disease is a highly contagious respiratory disease which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Current control measures used by many countries include social distancing, wearing face masks, frequent hand washing, self-isolation, and vaccination. The current commercially available vaccines are injectable vaccines, although a few intranasal vaccines are in trial stages. The reported side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, perceptions towards the safety of the vaccines, and frequent mutation of the virus may lead to poor herd immunity. In veterinary medicine, attaining herd immunity is one of the main considerations in disease control, and herd immunity depends on the use of efficacious vaccines and the vaccination coverage in a population. Hence, many aerosol or intranasal vaccines have been developed to control veterinary respiratory diseases such as Newcastle disease, rinderpest, infectious bronchitis, and haemorrhagic septicaemia. Different vaccine technologies could be employed to improve vaccination coverage, including the usage of an intranasal live recombinant vaccine or live mutant vaccine. This paper discusses the potential use of intranasal vaccination strategies against human COVID-19, based on a veterinary intranasal vaccine strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

In spite of the efforts to stop the disease, being out of the control of the governments it spread rapidly all over the world. From then on, much research has been done in the world with the aim of controlling this contagious disease. A mathematical model for modeling the spread of COVID-19 and also controlling the spread of the disease has been presented in this paper. We find the disease-free equilibrium points as trivial equilibrium (TE), virus absenteeism equilibrium (VAE) and virus incidence equilibrium (VIE) for the proposed model; and at the trivial equilibrium point for the presented dynamic system we obtain the Jacobian matrix so as to be used in finding the largest eigenvalue. Radius spectral method has been used for finding the reproductive number. In the following, by adding a controller to the model and also using the theory of optimal control, we can improve the performance of the model. We must have a correct understanding of the system i.e. how it works, the various variables affecting the system, and the interaction of the variables on each other. To search for the optimal values, we need to use an appropriate optimization method. Given the limitations and needs of the problem, the aim of the optimization is to find the best solutions, to find conditions that result in the maximum of susceptiblity, the minimum of infection, and optimal quarantination. © 2021","Controller; COVID-19; Equilibrium points; Jacobian matrix; Mathematical modelling; Optimal control; Pandemic disease; Protection covering; Reproductive number",

This study aimed to investigate the coping strategies among the healthcare workers from different countries and their attitude towards teamwork during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by using an online, web-based questionnaire, which was distributed to healthcare workers from 32 countries during April and May 2020. The respondents were recruited by the non-random convenience sampling method. Results: A total of 2166 respondents responded to the survey and the majority were working in low- and middle-income countries. Among them, 36% were doctors, 24% were nurses and 40% worked in other healthcare sectors. More than 70% of the respondents answered that “getting family support” and “positive thinking” were coping methods for them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately half of the respondents worshiped according to their belief and conducted prayers (58.4%) and had adequate sleep and food intake (48.2%). The significant associations were observed between attitude score towards interprofessional teamwork and gender (p = 0.009), age (31–45 years) (p < 0.001), marital status (p < 0.001), occupation (p < 0.001), working experience (2–5 years) (p = 0.005), current workplace (clinics) (p = 0.002). Conclusion: The local healthcare authorities should promote coping methods and develop an innovative way to encourage practicing among healthcare workers.

Methods: Our search was including original articles, reviews, guidelines, letters to the editor, comments on guidelines, and editorials, regarding the male reproductive system. We used the words SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, “2019 ncov,” testis, sperm, male factor infertility, fertility treatment, semen, assisted reproductive technology (ART), sexual transmission, and ACE2. Results: Data showed coronavirus affects men more than women because of more expression of 2019 nCoV receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in testicular cells. Also, “Bioinformatics Analysis” suggests that sperm production may be damaged, since “Pseudo Time Analysis” has shown disruption in spermatogenesis. “Gene Ontology” (GO) showed an increase in viral reproduction and a decrease in sperm production-related terms. Recently, SARS-COV-2 mRNA and protein were detected in the semen of patients that had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the probable disruption of blood-testis barrier (BTB) in febrile diseases is suspected in the acute phase of the disease enabling viral entry into the testes. Not only is spermatogenesis disturbed, but also disturbs gonadotropin, androgens, and testosterone secretion during SARS-CoV-2 infection. No sexual transmission has been reported yet; however, detection of the virus in semen still makes the sexual transmission an open question. Conclusion: There is a concern that male fertility may be disturbed after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, follow-up of the reproductive functions and male fertility may be necessary in recovered cases, especially in aged men. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Male reproduction; SARS-CoV-2; Sperm; Testis","androgen; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; gonadotropin; messenger RNA; transmembrane protease serine 2; bioinformatics; blood testis barrier; coronavirus disease 2019; endocrine system; fever; follow up; gene ontology; gonadotropin release; human; hypogonadism; immune response; infertility therapy; male fertility; male genital system; nonhuman; Note; pathogenesis; practice guideline; protein expression; semen cryopreservation; seminal plasma; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex difference; sexual transmission; sperm; spermatogenesis; testosterone release; vertical transmission; virus detection; virus entry; virus replication; complication; isolation and purification; male; male genital system; male infertility; pathology; virology; COVID-19; Genitalia, Male; Humans; Infertility, Male; Male; SARS-CoV-2"

The results revealed that the nurses were moderately competent in managing the COVID-19 care situation. Each of the 3 differentiating characteristics (age, work experience, and previous disaster experience) did not predict how nurses would manage COVID-19 preparedness significantly. Besides, we also found only 2 dimensions of preparedness (familiarity with epidemiology and surveillance and familiarity with psychological issues) significantly predicted nurses’ anxiety levels. Familiarity with epidemiology and surveillance predicted nurses’ anxiety positively; in contrast, familiarity with psychological issues negatively influenced nurses’ anxiety. © 2021 APJPH.","anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; nurses; preparedness; readiness",

We tracked the impacts of COVID-19 and associated policy responses on the availability and price of aquatic foods and production inputs during 2020, using a high frequency longitudinal survey of 768 respondents in Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Myanmar, Nigeria. We found the following: (1) Aquatic food value chains were severely disrupted but most effects on the availability and accessibility of aquatic foods and production inputs were short-lived. (2) Impacts on demand for aquatic foods, production inputs, and labor have been longer lasting than impacts on their supply. (3) Retail prices of aquatic foods spiked briefly during March-May 2020 but trended down thereafter, whereas prices of production inputs rose. These trends suggest a deepening ‘squeeze’ on the financial viability of producers and other value chain actors. (4) Survey respondents adapted to the challenges of COVID-19 by reducing production costs, sourcing alternative inputs, diversifying business activities, leveraging social capital, borrowing, seeking alternative employment, and reducing food consumption. Many of these coping strategies are likely to undermine well-being and longer-term resilience, but we also find some evidence of proactive strategies with potential to strengthen business performance. Global production of aquatic food likely contracted significantly in 2020. The importance of aquatic food value chains in supporting livelihoods and food and nutrition security in Asia and Africa makes their revitalization essential in the context of COVID-19 recovery efforts.

"Perception and attitude of adults toward cosmetic products amid COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104415820&doi=10.1111%2fjocd.14147&partnerID=40&md5=85c339078b802cbc6003a42e0e6f9ca9","Background: The use of cosmetics is growing among both male and female consumers due to the availability of different brands. While there is an increase in the usage of cosmetic products, it is concerning whether the consumers are aware of the safety of the products. Aims: This study aimed to widely explore consumers’ perceptions and attitudes toward cosmetics within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among adults in Selangor, Malaysia. Thirty-three questions divided into three dimensions (socio-demographic parameters, assessment of perception, and assessment of attitude) were developed and validated to be answered by cosmetics consumers. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Results: A response rate of 87% was achieved, and the mean age of participants was 33 ± 7.2. The overall perception of consumers indicates low levels of perception and moderate level of attitude toward cosmetic products. There was a positive correlation and high relationship between participants’ perception and attitude (p = 0.001, r = 0.72). A significant association was observed between demographic data of respondents and their attitude and perception toward cosmetic products. Participants were unaware that sharing of cosmetic products could lead to bacterial infection and possibly increased the chance of contracting COVID-19. Conclusion: This study displayed a nonchalant perception and attitude of Malaysian adults toward cosmetic products by focusing on aesthetics rather than health safety. Therefore, it is recommended to raise awareness on the composition and effects of cosmetic products, increase the practice of hygiene and dissuade the sharing of cosmetics to reduce transmissions of COVID-19. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","attitude; cosmetic products; perception","cosmetic; cosmetic; adult; Article; attitude to health; bacterial infection; consumer attitude; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; esthetics; female; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; pandemic; perception; safety; virus transmission; epidemiology; pandemic; perception; questionnaire; Adult; Cosmetics; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Pandemics; Perception; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires"

Thus, inhibition of S-protein-ACE2 binding may impede SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and attenuate the progression of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based biosensing platform consisting of a recombinant ACE2-coated palladium nano-thin-film electrode as the core sensing element was fabricated for the screening of potential inhibitors against S-protein-ACE2 binding. The platform could detect interference of small analytes against S-protein-ACE2 binding at low analyte concentration and small volume (0.1 μg/mL and ~1 μL, estimated total analyte consumption < 4 pg) within 21 min. Thus, a few potential inhibitors of S-protein-ACE2 binding were identified. This includes (2S,3aS,6aS)-1-((S)–N-((S)-1-Carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)alanyl)tetrahydrocyclopenta[b] pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (ramiprilat) and (2S,3aS,7aS)-1-[(2S)-2-[[(2S)-1-Carboxybutyl]amino]propanoyl]-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,7a-octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid (perindoprilat) that reduced the binding affinity of S-protein to ACE2 by 72% and 67%; and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infectivity to the ACE2-expressing human oral cavity squamous carcinoma cells (OEC-M1) by 36.4 and 20.1%, respectively, compared to the PBS control.

However, chemotherapy is often omitted either because of physician bias or because of its underlying comorbidity, thus compromising their survival. The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is compounding this issue because of the fear of immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy on the elderly which makes them more vulnerable to the virus. Summary: Immunotherapy has less effect on the patient bone marrow compared to chemotherapy. The potential synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy may improve local control and survival for older patients with selected cancer. Preliminary data are encouraging because of better survival and local control in diseases which are traditionally resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Key Message: We propose a new paradigm combining immunotherapy at a reduced dose and/or extended dosing intervals and hypofractionated radiotherapy for older patients with selected cancer which needs to be tested in future clinical trials. © 2021 S.

There is limited evidence on COVID-19 preparedness of such services in the Asia-Pacific region. Aim: To evaluate the preparedness and capacity of hospice and palliative care services in the Asia-Pacific region to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: An online cross-sectional survey was developed based on methodology guidance. Asia-Pacific Hospice and Palliative Care Network subscribers (n = 1551) and organizational members (n = 185) were emailed. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. Results: Ninety-seven respondents completed the survey. Around half of services were hospital-based (n = 47, 48%), and public-funded (n = 46, 47%). Half of services reported to have confirmed cases (n = 47, 49%) and the majority of the confirmed cases were patients (n = 28, 61%). Staff perceived moderate risk of being infected by COVID-19 (median: 7/10). > 85% of respondents reported they had up-to-date contact list for staff and patients, one-third revealed challenges to keep record of relatives who visited the services (n = 30, 31%), and of patients visited in communities (n = 29, 30%). Majority of services (60%) obtained adequate resources for infection control except face mask. More than half had no guidance on Do Not Resuscitate orders (n = 59, 66%) or on bereavement care for family members (n = 44, 51%). Conclusion: Recommendations to strengthen the preparedness of palliative care services include: 1) improving the access to face mask; 2) acquiring stress management protocols for staff when unavailable; 3) reinforcing the contact tracing system for relatives and visits in the community and 4) developing guidance on patient and family care during patient’s dying trajectory. © The Author(s) 2021.","Asia-Pacific region; COVID-19; epidemic; hospice and palliative care; pandemic; preparedness","Asia; cross-sectional study; hospice; hospice care; human; palliative therapy; pandemic; questionnaire; therapy; Asia; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospice Care; Hospices; Humans; Palliative Care; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires"

These disruptions have likewise affected the small-scale fishery (SSF) sector, disrupting SSF supply chains and exposing weaknesses in the global seafood distribution system. To inform future development of adaptive capacity and resilience in the sector, it is important to understand how supply chain actors are responding in the face of a macroeconomic shock. Comparing across seven SSF case studies in four countries, we explore how actors are responding to COVID-19 disruptions, identify constraints to adaptive responses, and describe patterns of disruption and response across cases. In all cases examined, actors shifted focus to local and regional distribution channels and particularly drew on flexibility, organization, and learning to re-purpose pre-existing networks and use technology to their advantage. Key constraints to reaching domestic consumers included domestic restrictions on movement and labor, reduced spending power amongst domestic consumers, and lack of existing distribution channels. In addition, the lack of recognition of SSFs as essential food-producers and inequities in access to technology hampered efforts to continue local seafood supply. We suggest that the initial impacts from COVID-19 highlight the risks in of over-reliance on global trade networks. The SSFs that were able to change strategies most successfully had local organizations and connections in place that they leveraged in innovative ways. As such, supporting local and domestic networks and flexible organizations within the supply chain may help build resilience in the face of future macroeconomic shocks. Importantly, bolstering financial wellbeing and security within the domestic market both before and during such large-scale disruptions is crucial for supporting ongoing supply chain operations and continued food provision during macroeconomic crises. © 2021","Adaptive capacity; COVID-19; Global seafood distribution system; Resilience; Small-scale fisheries; Supply chain","adaptive management; COVID-19; crisis management; economic impact; epidemic; financial system; fishery economics; fishery management; macroeconomics; pandemic; risk assessment; seafood; small scale industry; supply chain management"

This creates an additional challenge in medical waste management, particularly in developing countries. Improper managing of medical waste may have serious public health issues and a significant impact on the environment. There are currently three disinfection technologies, namely incineration, chemical and physical processes, that are available to treat COVID-19 medical waste (CMW). This study focuses on thermochemical process, particularly pyrolysis process to treat the medical waste. Pyrolysis is a process that utilizes the thermal instability of organic components in medical waste to convert them into valuable products. Besides, the technique is environmentally friendly, more efficient and cost-effective, requires less landfill capacity, and causes lower pollution. The current pandemic situation generates a large amount of plastic medical wastes, which mainly consists of polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, and nylon. These plastic wastes can be converted into valuable energy products like oil, gas and char through pyrolysis process. This review provides detailed information about CMW handling, treatment, valuable product generation, and proper discharge into the open environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19 medical waste; Disinfection techniques; Energy conversion; Medical waste management; Pyrolysis","Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Disinfection; Energy conversion; Plastic bottles; Polypropylenes; Thermodynamic stability; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; COVID-19 medical waste; Disinfection technique; Energy; Healthcare establishments; Impact on the environment; Incineration process; Medical waste management; Medical wastes; Public health issues; Pyrolysis process; Pyrolysis; nylon; polyethylene terephthalate; polypropylene; polystyrene; biodegradation; cost analysis; COVID-19; discharge; disinfection; epidemic; health care; organic compound; plastic waste; pyrolysis; catalytic pyrolysis; chemical waste; conventional pyrolysis; coronavirus disease 2019; energy consumption; flash pyrolysis; hospital waste; human; incineration; landfill leachate; plastic waste; prevalence; public health problem; pyrolysis; radioactive waste; retention time; Review; ultrarapid pyrolysis; waste management; waste water recycling; pyrolysis; COVID-19; Humans; Incineration; Medical Waste; Pyrolysis; SARS-CoV-2"

The short- and long-term COVID-19 consequences are depicted differently and may initially be viewed as an economic crisis. The results illustrate the reduced industrial productivity, which intensifies with the increase in the pandemic’s severeness (i.e., a 10.57% decrease in the productivity index with a 1% increase in the pandemic severeness). Similarly, indices for oil demand, stock market, GDP growth, and electricity demand decrease significantly with an increase in the pandemic severeness index (i.e., a 1% increase in the pandemic severeness results in a 0.9%, 0.67%, 1.12%, and 0.65% decrease, respectively).

The study was done at a large teaching hospital identified as a COVID-19 treating hospital. During COVID-19 pandemic, the country was in Movement Control Order since 18 March 2020 to contain the spread of the virus, and thus, it has increased the job workload and responsibility. The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of burnout among emergency healthcare worker in this hospital and to identify the factors contributed to the burnout. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire among emergency healthcare worker from 8 May 2020 to 15 May 2020 during the Conditional Movement Control Order. The questionnaire was adapted from Michelle Post, Public Welfare, Vol. 39, No. 1, 1981, American Public Welfare Association and distributed via Google Forms. It consisted of 28 questions and was rated based on a five-point Likert-type scale. The questions were then summed up to determine the burnout levels. Results: There were 216 respondents with 65.7% were nurses, 17.1% were doctors, and the rest were assistant medical officer. 51.3% of the respondents had burnout with 61.2% of nurses, 35.1% of doctors, and 29.6% of assistant medical officer. There was weak correlation (r = 0.148) with the years of experience working in emergency department and the level of burnout (p = 0.03). Among the burnout features were fatigue with 52.2% and frequent physical illness and feel unappreciated with 48.6% and 45.9%, respectively. The job-related issues which predisposed to burnout were demand coping with an angry public with 70.2%, job overload 63.9%, lack clear guideline or rapid program changes 54%, and pay too little 53.1%. Conclusion: Emergency healthcare worker has a high rate of burnout especially among the nurses. The factors leading to burnout were frequent exposure to angry public, job overload, lack of clear guidelines, and perception of underpaid. © The Author(s) 2021.","Burnout; emergency; factor; healthcare worker","adult; Article; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; emergency medicine; fatigue; female; health behavior; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; human; human experiment; Likert scale; male; medical personnel; nurse; pandemic; physical disease; physician; practice guideline; prevalence; professional burnout; questionnaire; salary; sleep debt; work environment; work experience; workload"

This study aims to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on consumers' food safety knowledge, attitude and practices and to identify the predictors of food safety practices during COVID-19. An online survey was conducted and received valid responses from 987 respondents. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, non-parametric tests, Spearman's rho correlation and multiple regression. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) model was used to investigate the intention to practice safe eating out measures during COVID-19. The mean food safety knowledge score was 6.37 ± 1.37 (9.00 = highest score) of which 91.3% of total respondents from Indonesia and Malaysia scored ≥5 points. Consumers also demonstrated positive food safety attitude (4.06 ± 0.99) and reported high frequencies in conducting food safety practices (4.03 ± 0.82) during COVID-19. The TPB has provided valuable framework for understanding consumers' intention to practice safe eating out measures during COVID-19. The multiple regression model explained 63% and 73% of the variance in adherence to safe eating out practices in Indonesia and Malaysia and (p < 0.05) respectively. All the TPB antecedents i.e. attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control were identified as significant predictors on consumers' eating out practices. This suggests that consumers with positive food safety attitude and strong family norms were more likely to adhere to safe eating out measures (e.g. selection of clean and less crowded restaurants, practicing hand hygiene, wearing masks and practising social distancing). The findings also suggest that to fully adhere to the safe practices, it is important to have sufficient support from restaurant staff to ensure social distancing and to provide adequate handwashing facilities. This is the first study to provide new empirical findings on consumers' intention to practice safe eating out measures during COVID-19. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Eating out; Food safety; Handwashing; Social distancing; Theory of planned behaviour",

Thus, the movement restrictions were put in place by most of the countries in the world including Asia and Australasia to manage the pandemic. This has disrupted the supply chains and mobility networks and the overall economic slowdown. Some of the impacts has seriously affected transport operator finances, including revenue and cash flow, moving many companies closer to bankruptcy. With road and transport sectors as the key driver of economic and social activities, the recovery from COVID-19 in countries all over the world is at risk. Thus, this paper presents the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on road and transport sectors in Asia and Australasia based on a quantitative method through an online questionnaire survey. One hundred and seventeen (117) participants from various countries and background have responded and gave their feedbacks on the impact factors. The findings shows that the top five (5) factors impacting the road and transport sectors are suspension of current activities and operations, followed by the reduction in company's revenue, profits, cashflow, turnover, interruption in construction planning and scheduling, transport disruptions to supply chains, mobility network and public transport usage and the transport travel pattern and ridership.

The disease is contagious and infected many people within short time. The Covid-19 has infected more than 100 million of reported cases according to the WHO with more than 2 million deaths. Many symptoms found in infectee of Covid-19 such as fever, dry cough, etc. One of the symptoms, shortness of breath, is found in 18.6% of infectee. Part of people infected by COVID-19 suffered from acute difficulty in breathing which need a help from ventilator for breathing. The ventilator plays important role in saving the Covid-19 patients. Ventilator can aid the patient to breath easily and supporting the lungs by letting in the sufficient air while encountering the hard breathing. In developed area, the ventilator is limited while the demand during pandemic gets increased. This paper proposes a low-cost prototype of ventilator for Covid-19 patient which integrated with IoT. The technology supports the clinicians to monitor the patient condition by letting the ventilator and the phone or tablet to be connected and exchange information. © 2021 IEEE.","Breathing Aid Devices; Covid-19; IoT; Novel Coronavirus; Ventilator","Automation; Intelligent systems; Process control; Coronaviruses; Infected patients; Low costs; Novel design; Patient condition; Technology support; Ventilator systems; Internet of things"

Though, many nations have finished the clinical trials period of vaccination and started vaccination to people, still there are many uncertainties such as how these vaccines will work to the people with severe illness, which vaccine is more effective compared to others etc. Moreover, vaccination may not provide a full protection against the current situation since there are new variants of corona virus and the number of affected people increasing again. Therefore, a proper diseases detection and individual monitoring system to maintain a smart quarantine facility is still very much needed to minimise the rapid spread of covid-19 and other contagious virus. Here, wearable tools could play important roles to provide valuable information of tracking people such as real-time remote monitoring, contact tracing symptoms prediction etc. to establish and maintain a proper quarantine system. In this manuscript we proposed a geofencing system with a wristband, integrating it with IOT and GPS to trace Covid-19 patients inside a boundary. This design could be an effective quarantine solution as a home isolation system for covid-19 patients as well as the travellers who cross borders. The performance of our proposed system was measured with respect to received signal strength indication (RSSI), GPS accuracy and coverage. © 2021 IEEE.","geofencing; location tracking; quarantine monitoring; smart wristband","Disease control; Remote control; Vaccines; Contact tracing; Current situation; Digital infrastructures; Individual monitoring; Isolation systems; Real-time remote monitoring; Received signal strength indication; Remote monitoring; Internet of things"

Here we describe our experience and assess the quality of an online training format based on participant outcomes for the first three modules of a planned series of online ART training. Materials and Methods: These modules included manual semen analysis, sperm morphology and ancillary semen tests (testing for leukocytospermia, sperm vitality, and anti-sperm antibody screening). The virtual format consisted of lecture presentations featuring laboratory protocols with corresponding video demonstrations of routine techniques and best practices. Practical scenarios, troubleshooting, and clinical interpretation of laboratory results were also discussed. At the end of each module, an optional multiple choice question test was held as a prerequisite to obtain certification on the topics presented. Course quality was assessed using participant responses collected via online surveys. Results: The digital delivery methods used were found to have largely or completely met the participants' expectations for all questions (>85%). The majority (>87%) of the participants either strongly agreed or agreed that the course content was well-structured with appropriate depth, and that their overall expectations of the course had been met. Conclusions: This training format appears to be a realistic teaching option to freely share highly specialized expertise and technical knowledge with participants from anywhere in the world with varying levels of competency or experience. © 2021 Korean Society for Sexual Medicine and Andrology.","Andrology; Education; Distance; Semen analysis; Surveys and questionnaires","sperm antibody; adult; aged; Article; certification; coronavirus disease 2019; course content; educational model; human; infertility therapy; male; multiple choice test; online system; pandemic; semen analysis; sperm; sperm viability; training"

The new instrument was developed through the review of relevant literature. We adapted multiple items from the following tools: The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Social Phobia Inventory, Health Anxiety Inventory, Swine Influenza Anxiety Scale and the Arabic Scale of Death Anxiety to design our new assessment tool which is called COVID-19 Psychological Distress Scale (CPDS). For psychometric analyses and validation, we conducted a cross-sectional study that solicited data through a web-based survey using the newly developed CPDS. This validation study was conducted in four Arab countries, including Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. A total of 1337 participants from these countries have voluntarily responded to our survey questionnaire that included the newly developed scale. The final version of the CPDS comprised 12 items. Participants from Algeria (n=447), Kuwait (n=437), Saudi Arabia (n=160) and Yemen (n=293) have completed the 12-item CPDS. Exploratory factor analysis (used on the Algerian sample) suggested a two-factor structure of the CPDS. The two-factor structure was then supported by the confirmatory factor analysis with an independent sample. Additionally, Rasch analyses showed that all the items fit well in their embedded construct; only one item showed somewhat substantial differential item functioning across gender and country. The 12-item CPDS was found to be measurement invariant across country and gender. The CPDS, with its promising psychometric properties, might help healthcare professionals to identify people with COVID-19-induced psychological distress. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

The Indonesian government has been confronted with issues such as health services, case detection, the financial capacity of the state, and the decline of economic activity. This study aimed to examine the policies and social advantages of “the new normal” as a case study of handling the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. This was a qualitative study using primary and secondary data. The study showed that the government’s responses were ineffective and insufficient for preparing contingency measures. Poor coordination between central and regional governments has also been observed as a public concern. The central government decided to implement a large-scale social distancing policy instead of imposing a total lockdown due to its massive financial burden on the government. While making the policies, the central government was concerned more with political and economic considerations and prohibited regional governments from imposing local lockdown policies, unless permitted by the central government. This situation allegedly resulted in substandard protection of the people from the pandemic. The central government’s budgeting policy also failed to put more emphasis on the public health services because the budget for the health sector was lower than the budget for economic recovery and social assistance. However, notwithstanding the government’s unproductive policies in handling the pandemic, Indonesian people have mutual assistance culture as a social advantage. Through such social capital, people were driven to help each other, especially regarding social and economic assistance to the affected people. Contrarily, mutual awareness may have driven people to refrain from doing activities in public areas and to stay at home to stop the spread of COVID-19. It boosted the social endurance of the people in dealing with the pandemic toward a new normal. © Common Ground Research Networks, Rusman Ghazali, TB Massa Djafar, Sity Daud, All Rights Reserved.","Capitalists; Economic Impact; Government; Handling the COVID-19; Mutual Assistance; New Normal; Pandemic; People; Policies; Public Health; Social Advantages; Social Impact; World Health Organization",

It was found that with organizations that had supply chains, inter-firm dependence not only had a positive effect on their financial performance, but the development of technology or e-business systems development is also improved. This occurred because the pressure from their partners' technologies made other partners feel the need to improve the technologies of their business. We realized that managing knowledge and creativity provided many benefits when it was combined with advanced technology especially in the Pandemic of COVID-19. Method/Analysis: This study use a qualitative and quantitative method such as interview and observation (qualitative) to verify of questionnaires (quantitative) by experts in the field of logistics especially in courier firms and e-business companies. Then for analyzing data we use SMART-PLS. Findings: This study proves that inter-firm dependence between courier companies and e-business firms are significant as well as they were able to contribute to new services developed especially for a crucial situation such as COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic is speeding up the trend towards digital. Small and medium-sized companies are also able to improve relationships with established customers while developing and leveraging new partnerships, especially with their logistics partners, by being active digitally. Application: In conclusion, it could help to recognize the current management and capacity levels, as well as the role of courier services and e-business performance. Thus, it could help both of them to renew their views of inter-company dependence management effects as well as to enhance their organizational practices, and that they'll survive the market. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Electronic commerce; Supply chains; Surveys; Advanced technology; E-business company; E-business performance; E-business systems; Financial performance; Organizational practices; Quantitative method; Small and medium-sized companies; Service industry"

This horrendously contagious viral outbreak was first identified in China and within a very short time it affected the world's health, transport, economic, and academic sectors. Despite the recent approval of a few anti-COVID-19 vaccines, their unavailability and insufficiency along with the lack of other potential therapeutic options are continuing to worsen the situation, with valuable lives continuing to be lost. In this situation, researchers across the globe are focusing on repurposing prospective drugs and prophylaxis such as favipiravir, remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin, doxycycline, ACEIs/ARBs, rivaroxaban, and protease inhibitors, which were preliminarily based on in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and toxicological study reports followed by clinical applications. Based on available preliminary data derived from limited clinical trials, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) and USFDA also recommended a few drugs to be repurposed i.e., hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and favipiravir. However, World Health Organization later recommended against the use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19 infections. Combining basic knowledge of viral pathogenesis and pharmacodynamics of drug molecules as well as in silico approaches, many drug candidates have been investigated in clinical trials, some of which have been proven to be partially effective against COVID-19, and many of the other drugs are currently under extensive screening. The repurposing of prospective drug candidates from different stages of evaluation can be a handy wellspring in COVID-19 management and treatment along with approved anti-COVID-19 vaccines.

On 29th April 2020, Malaysia reported more than 5,000 COVID-19 cases; the second highest in the Southeast Asian region after Singapore. Recently, a forecasting model was developed to measure and predict COVID-19 cases in Malaysia on daily basis for the next 10 days using previously-confirmed cases. A Recurrent Forecasting-Singular Spectrum Analysis (RF-SSA) is proposed by establishing L and ET parameters via several tests. The advantage of using this forecasting model is it would discriminate noise in a time series trend and produce significant forecasting results. The RF-SSA model assessment was based on the official COVID-19 data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) to predict daily confirmed cases between 30th April and 31st May, 2020. These results revealed that parameter L = 5 (T/20) for the RF-SSA model was indeed suitable for short-time series outbreak data, while the appropriate number of eigentriples was integral as it influenced the forecasting results. Evidently, the RF-SSA had over-forecasted the cases by 0.36%. This signifies the competence of RF-SSA in predicting the impending number of COVID-19 cases. Nonetheless, an enhanced RF-SSA algorithm should be developed for higher effectivity of capturing any extreme data changes. © Copyright © 2021 Shaharudin, Ismail, Hassan, Tan and Sulaiman.","COVID-19; eigentriples; forecasting; recurrent forecasting; singular spectrum analysis; trend; window length","China; human; Malaysia; Singapore; spectroscopy; China; COVID-19; Humans; Malaysia; SARS-CoV-2; Singapore; Spectrum Analysis"

Blood samples were taken from patients ca. 3 months after acute COVID-19 infection with further assessment of symptoms at 6 months. Some 57% of the patients had one or more persistent symptoms including respiratory-related symptoms like cough, dyspnea, and rhinorrhea or other nonrespiratory symptoms including chronic fatigue, anosmia, myalgia, or joint pain. Plasma samples were quantitatively analyzed for lipoproteins, glycoproteins, amino acids, biogenic amines, and tryptophan pathway intermediates using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Metabolic data for the follow-up patients (n = 27) were compared with controls (n = 41) and hospitalized severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 18, with multiple time-points). Univariate and multivariate statistics revealed variable patterns of functional recovery with many patients exhibiting residual COVID-19 biomarker signatures. Several parameters were persistently perturbed, e.g., elevated taurine (p = 3.6 × 10-3 versus controls) and reduced glutamine/glutamate ratio (p = 6.95 × 10-8 versus controls), indicative of possible liver and muscle damage and a high energy demand linked to more generalized tissue repair or immune function. Some parameters showed near-complete normalization, e.g., the plasma apolipoprotein B100/A1 ratio was similar to that of healthy controls but significantly lower (p = 4.2 × 10-3) than post-acute COVID-19 patients, reflecting partial reversion of the metabolic phenotype (phenoreversion) toward the healthy metabolic state. Plasma neopterin was normalized in all follow-up patients, indicative of a reduction in the adaptive immune activity that has been previously detected in active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other systemic inflammatory biomarkers such as GlycA and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio remained elevated in some, but not all, patients. Correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and orthogonal-partial least-squares discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) showed that the follow-up patients were, as a group, metabolically distinct from controls and partially comapped with the acute-phase patients. Significant systematic metabolic differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic follow-up patients were also observed for multiple metabolites. The overall metabolic variance of the symptomatic patients was significantly greater than that of nonsymptomatic patients for multiple parameters (χ2 p = 0.014). Thus, asymptomatic follow-up patients including those with post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome displayed a spectrum of multiple persistent biochemical pathophysiology, suggesting that the metabolic phenotyping approach may be deployed for multisystem functional assessment of individual post-acute COVID-19 patients. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","amino acids; biomarkers; COVID-19; lipoproteins; long-COVID syndrome; multiorgan disease; phenoconversion; phenoreversion; plasma; post-acute COVID-19 syndrome; post-acute COVID-19 syndrome; SARS-CoV-2","amino acid; apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein B100; biogenic amine; biological marker; glutamic acid; glutamine; glycoprotein; kynurenine; lipoprotein; neopterin; taurine; tryptophan; lipoprotein; amino acid analysis; anosmia; arthralgia; Article; asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019; blood sampling; chronic fatigue syndrome; clinical article; controlled study; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; follow up; hospital patient; human; inflammation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver injury; mass spectrometry; metabolic phenotype; muscle injury; myalgia; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; protein blood level; quantitative analysis; revertant; rhinorrhea; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tissue repair; tryptophan metabolism; complication; COVID-19; Humans; Lipoproteins; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; SARS-CoV-2"

Besides describing the spatio-temporal contagion risk of the virus, ultimately, it seeks to test the hypothesis that higher population density results in exacerbated COVID-19 virulence in the community. The population density of 143 districts in Malaysia, as per data from Malaysia’s 2010 population census, was plotted against cumulative COVID-19 cases and infection rates of COVID-19 cases, which were obtained from Malaysia’s Ministry of Health official website. The data of these three variables were collected between 19 January 2020 and 31 December 2020. Based on the observations, districts that have high population densities and are highly inter-connected with neighbouring districts, whether geographically, socio-economically, or infrastructurally, tend to experience spikes in COVID-19 cases within weeks of each other. Using a parametric approach of the Pearson correlation, population density was found to have a moderately strong relationship to cumulative COVID-19 cases (p-value of 0.000 and R2 of 0.415) and a weak relationship to COVID-19 infection rates (p-value of 0.005 and R2 of 0.047). Consequently, we provide several non-pharmaceutical lessons, including urban planning strategies, as passive containment measures that may better support disease interventions against future contagious diseases. © 2021 by the authors.

"The impact of the covid-19 self-isolation policy on the occupations of vulnerable groups",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107888704&doi=10.3390%2fijerph18126452&partnerID=40&md5=9521a23765bdfee8ec9c56240259a714","Today, the spread of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to impact on world public health and bring about considerable human suffering partly due to government policies on reducing the spread. COVID-19 has significantly affected human health and it has impacted on the occupation of vulnerable groups such as tour guides, drivers and shop assistants. Of these, the present study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 self-isolation policy on the occupation of vulnerable groups in Semarang City, Indonesia. To achieve this objective, this study uses a qualitative method with an ethnography approach considering a rational or non-rational thinking model. The binary opposition thinking pattern pioneered by Lévi-Strauss was used in the interview process with 25 informants in Semarang City, Indonesia. The data analyzed the response pattern of informants through the taxonomy analysis. Three levels of vulnerability among groups relating to occupation were identified; jobs lost, income decreased, and delayed salary. The result of the analysis found that the group who obeyed self-isolation was categorized as a rational thinking; these groups stay at home, do not go to work, and have no income. Besides that, the group who ignored self-isolation is categorized as non-rational thinking; they work, as usual, get their salary, and believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster and they pray for their safety to God. In conclusion, COVID-19 brings a significant impact on occupation in the forms of postponing, declining, and missing income besides the health effects among vulnerable groups in Semarang city, Indonesia. In avoiding COVID-19 infection, the circumstances of vulnerable groups are worse when self-isolation is required. Thus, this study suggests that the government needs to assist vulnerable groups by focusing on strategic policies, such as strategies for survival, providing access to basic needs, including health, and offering livelihood plans by providing access to medical services and other source of income. © 2021 by the authors.

Although multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified, using this data to improve clinical care has proven challenging. The main aim of this study is to develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, thus enabling risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making. Methods: Anonymised data consisting of 44 independent predictor variables from 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case–control analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, required ventilatory support, and duration of inpatient treatment. Pulmonary embolism sequala was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were then learned and constructed using Bayesian networks. Results: The proposed probabilistic models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of the mentioned outcomes. Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable, quantitative predictive models for four outcomes, which utilise readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as risk stratification and clinical decision-making tools. © 2021 by the authors.

The emergence of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (Covid-19) and declared a pandemic at the beginning of 2020 has led to an unprecedented economic crisis in Malaysia, as in most other countries. As the number of Covid cases increased after the first case was discovered in January 2020, the government implemented different degrees of Movement Control Orders (MCO) from 18th March till the current day at the point of writing this paper. The lockdown in Malaysia as well as many other countries led to supply and demand shocks, which has in turn affected the country’s cross border trade. Exports dropped continuously in the first five months of 2020 before recovering. The purpose of this article is to identify the key trade partners that contributed towards Malaysia’s export recovery in 2020, especially the role of China given the fact that it is Malaysia’s largest trading partner since 2010. Specifically, it examines how economic recovery in the major trade partners are correlated with Malaysia’s export recovery as well as the causal relationship underpinning the export recovery in 2020. The study shows that trade recovery in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic goes beyond domestic policy and production measures. Economic recovery in partner countries played a role too. © 2021, Institute of China Studies. All rights reserved.","Empirical study of trade; International economic order and integration; Trade",

Both countries are the top two palm oil producers in the world and have ambitious targets to increase the palm oil-based biodiesel mandate. In Indonesia, the current programme of blending 20 per cent palm oil into 80 per cent diesel (B20) increases to B30 in 2020. Likewise, Malaysia plans to increase its biodiesel mandate from B10 to B20 in 2020. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has infected millions and brought the global economy to a near-deadlock. The effect is particularly severe in the fuel industry owing to movement restrictions and the historic drop in oil prices. Evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 on the biodiesel industry is crucial for policymakers but challenging as the pandemic has evolved with intense speed. This article aims to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the Indonesian and Malaysian biodiesel industry. In addition to that, a number of possible solutions to overcome the challenges were addressed and proposed. Despite severely affected by COVID-19, both Indonesia and Malaysia can use this momentum to improve and strengthen their biodiesel sector. Given its fiscal deficit, Indonesia should postpone its biodiesel blending mandate as the subsidy to support the programme can worsen the country’s financial stability. In Malaysia, where labour shortage is prevalent, modernising plantations with automated equipment, for instance, could potentially remove the dirty and dangerous stereotypes associated with plantation works, thus attracting more locals to work in the palm oil plantation and solving the labour shortage. This paper also briefly addresses the adoption of Industry 4.0 and Circular Economy for the palm oil biodiesel industry. © The Authors 2021. Published by Penerbit UMP.

This research examines the ability of young adults in Malaysia to spot fake news and how do they counter its spread. This study also analyses the level of new media literacy among young adults to process fake news on social media. A quantitative data collection method using questionnaires was used to collect data from 450 young adults. Results showed that despite being confident of being able to distinguish fake news from real news, young adults have difficulties to differentiate between verifiable news and fake news. Respondents are also proactive in combatting the spread of fake news, where a large percentage would re-share the post to notify other users. Finally, study results also found that young adults have a moderate level of new media literacy.

This paper will share Malaysia’s experience in fighting the pandemic, particularly the key success factors in managing the health impact during the period of January to August 2020. The speedy preparation and planning by the Health Ministry even before the country registered its first case was instrumental in ensuring that the country was ready to face the pandemic. Lessons learned from previous experience with epidemics such as Nipah, SARS, MERS, and H1N1 were also key to the speedy responses. Effective communication helped to ensure the public’s support of measures imposed by the government to reduce the spread of the virus. However, while the country managed the health crisis relatively well, the handling of the economy is rather poor, with the economic impact being much worse than what was experienced during the 1997–98 Asian financial crisis, and the 2008–09 global financial crisis.

The virus surfaced towards the end of December 2019 in Wuhan, China where earlier SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) had also surfaced in 2003. Unlike SARS, SARS-CoV-2 (a close relative of the SARS virus) created a pandemic, and as of February 24 2021, caused 112,778,672 infections and 2,499,252 deaths world-wide. Despite the best efforts of scientists, no drugs against COVID-19 are yet in sight; five vaccines have received emergency approval in various countries, but it would be a difficult task to vaccinate twice the world population of 8 billion. The objective of the present study was to evaluate through in silico screening a number of phytochemicals in Allium cepa (onion) regarding their ability to bind to the main protease of COVID-19 known as the 3C-like protease or 3CLpro, (PDB ID: 6LU7), 3CLpro of SARS (PDB ID: 3M3V), and human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), [PDB ID: 1R42], which functions as a receptor for entry of the virus into humans. Molecular docking (blind docking, that is docking not only against any target pocket) were done with the help of AutoDockVina. It was observed that of the twenty-two phytochemicals screened, twelve showed good binding affinities to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, the compounds also demonstrated good binding affinities to ACE-2. It is therefore very likely that the binding affinities shown by these compounds against both 3CLpro and ACE-2 merit further study for their potential use as therapeutic agents. © 2021, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

Methods: A total of 204 Malaysian parents of children aged 2 to 11 years old were recruited for this study using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling approaches. Parents were required to fill an online questionnaire hosted on Google Forms, which consisted of socio-demographic characteristics (including child's gender, age, and ethnicity, as well as parental income during the MCO) and a 35-item list from the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ). Data analysis was conducted by further stratifying the children's eating behaviour according to socio-demographic characteristics. Results: No significant differences were observed in the eating behaviour of the children across age and parental income groups during the MCO. Malaysian Indian children had significantly lower mean scores for the food responsiveness (2.50±0.64) and emotional over-eating (2.13±0.72) subscales than Malaysian Chinese children. Girls had a significantly higher mean score for the slowness in eating subscale during the MCO than boys.

It had spread worldwide and was declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic by March 2020. Patients presented with a wide range of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems predominantly the lungs. Severe cases required intensive care unit (ICU) admissions while there were asymptomatic cases as well. Although early detection of the COVID-19 virus by Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is effective, it is not efficient; as there can be false negatives, it is time consuming and expensive. To increase the accuracy of in-vivo detection, radiological image-based methods like a simple chest X-ray (CXR) can be utilized. This reduces the false negatives as compared to solely using the RT-PCR technique. This paper employs various image processing techniques besides extracted texture features from the radiological images and feeds them to different artificial intelligence (AI) scenarios to distinguish between normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. The best scenario is then adopted to build an automated system that can segment the chest region from the acquired image, enhance the segmented region then extract the texture features, and finally, classify it into one of the three classes. The best overall accuracy achieved is 93.1% by exploiting Ensemble classifier.

Work from home is a logistic challenge for the health, retail, and manufacturing sectors. Hence, a workspace probe is imperative to obtain elementary evidence to fine-tune implementation strategy in pandemic crisis management. Sparse information concerning the workspace of the eye examination rooms inducted this investigation to gather the footing data towards impending preparation of post-COVID-19 new norms for optical outlets in Malaysia. Methods: Nine optical outlets with a combination of commercial chains, individual practices, suburban and urban areas were selected to represent assorted types of retail settings. The on-site workspaces’ data were measured and recorded in a logbook with a laser meter and measurement tape. Self-assessments of workspaces were gathered through structured interviews. Results: The on-site data revealed that all-optical outlets did not comply with the minimum requirement for an optimal eye examination in terms of space area and illuminance. None of the eye examination rooms had a built-in air filtering system and handwash infrastructure. Paradoxically, the functionality of the workspace was self-graded as ‘above average’. Conclusion: Variation in the eye examination room designs and deviance from the standard requirement may just be a noticeable part of a larger problem about the service quality of optical outlets. Lack of basic hygiene facilities requires action for preventive measures. The incongruity between the self-assessment and the on-site data might indicate a conjectural challenge to efficiently self-implement the post-COVID-19 workspace new norm in optical outlets. © 2021 UPM Press.

Results: The research results showed that 30.3% of the respondents had poor and remaining 69.7% had good COVID-19 transmission prevention behavior. As many as 66.7% of the respondents had good knowledge, while 42.4 % had constructive perception of COVID-19 transmission prevention behavior. The analysis test showed that there were significant relationships between knowledge and perceptions related to COVID-19 transmission prevention behavior. Managers are suggested to improve workers’ knowledge and perceptions on COVID-19 transmission prevention. Conclusion: Workers with good knowledge were twice as likely to have good COVID-19 transmission prevention behavior. © 2021 UPM Press.

There are four main clusters had been identi-fied. This cluster has involved infection up to the third generation. The aim of this study also was to determine the distribution of chronic disease among COVID-19 death patients by revealing the frequencies of the most common chronic diseases. Besides that, trend analysis according to the number of individuals in the ICU and the number of individuals in the ICU with ventilator support is being studied. This is very important to predict the number of ventilators needs while the trend of patients in ICU is increased. The last objective of this study is to determine the distribution of chronic diseases among male and female patients, revealing the most common chronic disease among death patients. Materials and Methods: Data collection started on March 8th 2020 till April 6th, 2020 among the individual who died with COVID-19. The collected data consist of the gender, the cluster of infection, patient chronic disease, number of daily data on COVID-19 death, individuals in the ICU, individual in the ICU with the ventilator. SPSS software version 26.0 and MINITAB 17 was used to assess the important information through descriptive statistics, multiple response analysis, and trend analysis. Results: The total COVID-19 death in Malaysia till April 6th 2020 was 62 cases. It was higher in male with 48 (77.4%) cases as compared to female which was 14 (22.6%) cases. Most of the infected cases are come from the Sri Petaling tabligh religious gathering which contributes about 11 (34.3%), travel history to oversea 11 (34.3%) and follow by close contact with Covid-19 cases 8 (25.0%). Through multiple response analyses, it was found that, most of the individuals who died with Covid-19 have chronic disease such as hypertension (31.1%), diabetes mellitus (28.4%) and heart disease (11.9%). Most of the dead patients shows that they have hypertension. Besides that, the number of covid-19 patients also was summarized according to the hospital in Malaysia. Sarawak General Hospital having the highest death of covid-19 patients followed by Kuala Lumpur Hospital. Trend analysis was plotted in order to see the pattern of the patient which being entered to ICU, and the patient which depen-dent on the ventilator used. Conclusion: The number of death cases continues on an upward trend, but it is still under control. This is because of the suc-cess of first Malaysian Movement Control Order (MCO) which is implemented by the Malaysian government on March 18th, 2020. Based on the daily increasing number of death cases reported and also the infected number of COVID-19, the Malaysian government once again announced the extension of MCO up to the 14th of April 2020. The finding from this study will provide some information about the Malaysian situation and also prepared the strategy to decrease the number of infections and death among the COVID-19. © 2021 Japan University of Health Sciences & Japan International Cultural Exchange Foundation.","Covid-19; Multiple response; Trend analysis",

This article discusses issues related to (science) communication at different phases of the COVID-19 epidemic timeline. We consider the role of communication for prevention from the ecological perspective, taking into consideration that many emerging pathogens, including COVID-19, likely arise in part due to anthropogenic changes to natural environments. Communication forms part of the early response setting the scene for public buy-in of public health interventions at the start of an outbreak, as well as to maintain precautions over time. Finally, communication is a key element in increasing acceptance for new tools that require mass uptake to be effective, as seen with roll-out challenges for the COVID-19 vaccines, which faced heightened concerns of efficacy and safety while mired with rampant misinformation. Ultimately, strategies for prevention of viral epidemics such as COVID-19 must include communication strategies at the forefront to reduce the risk of the emergence of new diseases and enhance efforts to control their spread and burden. Despite key themes emerging, what constitutes effective communication strategies for different people and contexts needs to be investigated further. © 2021 by the authors.

The study aimed to identify therapeutic approaches and drugs that can potentially be used as interventions in Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) management. A systematic scoping review was conducted. Articles reporting clinical evidence of therapeutic management of COVID-19 were selected from three different research databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct). From the database search, 31 articles were selected based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review paper showed that remdesivir and ivermectin significantly reduced viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) activity. On the other hand, convalescent plasma (CP) significantly improved COVID-19 clinical symptoms. Additionally, the use of corticosteroid increased survival rates in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Findings also indicated that both hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir were effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Within a year, a few COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized. This unparalleled initiative in developing vaccines created many uncertainties looming around the efficacy and safety of these vaccines. This study aimed to assess the side effects and perceptions following COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing an online survey targeted toward Jordan inhabitants who received any COVID-19 vaccines. Data were statistically analyzed and certain machine learning (ML) tools, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and K-star were used to predict the severity of side effects. Results: A total of 2213 participants were involved in the study after receiving Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and other vaccines (38.2%, 31%, 27.3%, and 3.5%, respectively). Generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). Only 10% of participants suffered from severe side effects; while 39% and 21% of participants had moderate and mild side effects, respectively. Despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against COVID-19 infection. Finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety; while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. Furthermore, based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and side effects, the RF, XGBoost, and MLP gave both high accuracies (0.80, 0.79, and 0.70, respectively) and Cohen’s kappa values (0.71, 0.70, and 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: The present study confirmed that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. Most of the post-vaccination side effects are mild to moderate, which are signs that body’s immune system is building protection. ML can also be used to predict the severity of side effects based on the input data; predicted severe cases may require more medical attention or even hospitalization. © 2021 by the authors.

The risk and protective factors associated with high compliance to these preventive measures are critical to enhancing pandemic preparedness. Objective: This survey aims to assess differences in mental health, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of preventive measures for COVID-19 amongst healthcare professionals (HCP) and non-healthcare professionals. Design: Multi-national cross-sectional study was carried out using electronic surveys between May-June 2020. Setting: Multi-national survey was distributed across 36 countries through social media, word-ofmouth, and electronic mail. Participants: Participants ≥21 years working in healthcare and non-healthcare related professions. Main outcome: Risk factors determining the difference in KAP towards personal hygiene and social distancing measures during COVID-19 amongst HCP and non-HCP. Results: HCP were significantly more knowledgeable on personal hygiene (AdjOR 1.45, 95% CI -1.14 to 1.83) and social distancing (AdjOR 1.31, 95% CI -1.06 to 1.61) compared to non- HCP. They were more likely to have a positive attitude towards personal hygiene and 1.5 times more willing to participate in the contact tracing app. There was high compliance towards personal hygiene and social distancing measures amongst HCP. HCP with high compliance were 1.8 times more likely to flourish and more likely to have a high sense of emotional (AdjOR 1.94, 95% CI (1.44 to 2.61), social (AdjOR 2.07, 95% CI -1.55 to 2.78), and psychological (AdjOR 2.13, 95% CI (1.59-2.85) well-being. Conclusion and relevance: While healthcare professionals were more knowledgeable, had more positive attitudes, their higher sense of total well-being was seen to be more critical to enhance compliance. Therefore, focusing on the well-being of the general population would help to enhance their compliance towards the preventive measures for COVID-19. © 2021 Shah et al.",,"adult; Article; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; female; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; human; infection prevention; male; mental health; personal hygiene; professional knowledge; protocol compliance; risk factor; social distancing; social media; wellbeing; attitude to health; epidemiology; global health; health care personnel; middle aged; pandemic; patient compliance; psychology; questionnaire; Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Global Health; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Compliance; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires"

Research and training focus on harnessing educators, but less is understood at the students’ ends. This study examines the OL readiness components, self-regulation, enablers, and barriers to OL at home among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic through an explanatory mixed-method study. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 178 students and an in-depth interview with 10 students from a public medical school in Malaysia. We found that while all students owned at least one learning device, 22.5% of the students did not have a learning space at home. 21.9% students did not have Wi-Fi access, and 11.2% did not receive mobile broadband coverage at home. Despite these barriers, students had a suitable OL self-regulation level. Significantly higher self-regulation was observed among pre-clinical year students, students with higher grades, and students who had designated learning space at home. We found that high-immediacy and low-bandwidth applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram, and YouTube as the most accessible and easiest platforms to navigate in OL. Our qualitative findings yielded a conceptual model of OL enablers at learners, educators, and institution levels. This framework may serve as one of the guides in faculty development planning and policymaking, especially in promoting a more socially inclusive OL. © 2021 by the authors.

These problems have created significant psychological and mental health concerns for frontline healthcare providers. This study aimed to compare the levels of vicarious traumatization between frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology All the subjects who met the inclusion criteria were recruited for this comparative cross-sectional study, which was conducted from May to July 2020 in two hospitals in Kelantan, Malaysia. A self-administered questionnaire, namely, the Malay-version Vicarious Traumatization Questionnaire and the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey were utilized. A descriptive analysis, independent t-test, and analysis of covariance were performed using SPSS Statistics version 26. Results A total of 160 frontline and 146 non-frontline healthcare providers were recruited. Vicarious traumatization was significantly higher among the non-frontline healthcare providers (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: 79.7 [75.12, 84.30]) compared to the frontline healthcare providers (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: 74.3 [68.26, 80.37]) after adjusting for sex, duration of employment, and social support. Conclusion The level of vicarious traumatization was higher among non-frontline compared to frontline healthcare providers. However, the level of severity may differ from person to person, depending on how they handle their physical, psychological, and mental health. Hence, support from various resources, such as colleagues, family, the general public, and the government, may play an essential role in the mental health of healthcare providers.

Methods: Using open data repository with daily infected, recovered and death cases in the period between March 2020 and April 2021, a descriptive analysis was performed. The susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery model was used to estimate the effective productive number (Rt). The duration taken from Rt &gt; 1 to Rt &lt; 1 and case load were first modelled by using the compound Poisson method. Machine learning analysis using the K-means clustering method was further adopted to classify patterns of community-acquired outbreaks worldwide. Results: The global estimated Rt declined after the first surge of COVID-19 pandemic but there were still two major surges of epidemics occurring in September 2020 and March 2021, respectively, and numerous episodes due to various extents of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Unsupervised machine learning identified five patterns as “controlled epidemic”, “mutant propagated epidemic”, “propagated epidemic”, “persistent epidemic” and “long persistent epidemic” with the corresponding duration and the logarithm of case load from the lowest (18.6 ± 11.7; 3.4 ± 1.8)) to the highest (258.2 ± 31.9; 11.9 ± 2.4). Countries like Taiwan outside five clusters were classified as no community-acquired outbreak. Conclusion: Data-driven models for the new classification of community-acquired outbreaks are useful for global surveillance of uninterrupted COVID-19 pandemic and provide a timely decision support for the distribution of vaccine and the optimal NPIs from global to local community. © 2021","Cluster analysis; Community-acquired outbreak; COVID-19; Machine learning","Article; Asia; community acquired infection; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; human; k means clustering; machine learning; mortality rate; pandemic; risk factor; social distancing; statistical model; Taiwan; unsupervised machine learning; machine learning; pandemic; statistical model; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Statistical; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Taiwan"

However, there is a paucity of evidence quantifying PTSD status globally during confinement in quarantine/isolation facilities during COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to assess the PTSD status and factors contributing to PTSD development in quarantined/isolated people during pandemic. Using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scale, our multicentre, multinational, and cross-sectional online survey assessed the psychological impacts on the quarantine/isolation experience of participants suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, their PTSD status, and various correlates with developing PTSD. We had 944 (35.33%) valid responses (51.1% from females), mostly from Asian countries (635, 71.4%), and 33.9% were healthcare workers. The number of quarantine days in the PTSD symptoms group (using the IES-R cutoff of 24 for symptomatic or full PTSD) was significantly shorter compared to the non-PTSD group (14 (range 14-40) vs. 14 (14-23.75), p = 0.031). Lower rates of PTSD symptoms were observed in participants practicing Buddhist religion than in participants having no religion (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.13-0.68; p = 0.005); individuals with vocational training had a higher risk of developing PTSD symptoms (OR: 2.28 (1.04-5.15); p = 0.043) compared to university graduates. Individuals forced to be quarantined/isolated had higher odds of developing PTSD symptoms than those voluntarily quarantined/isolated (OR: 2.92 (1.84-4.74); p < 0.001). We identified several PTSD correlations among individuals quarantined/isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic, including religious practice, reason for quarantine/isolation, education level, and being a case of the infection. These findings can inform worldwide policies to minimize the adverse effects of such social control measures. © 2021 by the author.","COVID-19; Global survey; Impact of event-scale; Isolation; Mental health; Pandemic; PTSD; Quarantine","COVID-19; developing world; epidemiology; health worker; mental disorder; psychology; religion; survey method"

Research into how the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus together with its individual constituent genes and proteins interact with target host cells can facilitate the development of improved strategies to manage the acute and long-term complications of COVID-19. In this study, to better understand the biological roles of critical SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we determined and compared the host tran-scriptomic responses of the HL-CZ human pro-monocytic cell line upon transfection with key viral genes encoding the spike S1 subunit, S2 subunit, nucleocapsid protein (NP), NSP15 (endoribonu-clease), and NSP16 (2′-O-ribose-methyltransferase). RNA sequencing followed by gene set enrich-ment analysis and other bioinformatics tools revealed that host genes associated with topologically incorrect protein, virus receptor activity, heat shock protein binding, endoplasmic reticulum stress, antigen processing and presentation were up-regulated in the presence of viral spike S1 expression. With spike S2 expression, pro-monocytic genes associated with the interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway, regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, adipocytokine signaling pathway, and insulin signaling pathway were down-regulated, whereas those associated with cy-tokine-mediated signaling were up-regulated. The expression of NSP15 induced the up-regulation of genes associated with neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil-mediated immunity, oxidative phos-phorylation, prion disease, and pathways of neurodegeneration. The expression of NSP16 resulted in the down-regulation of genes associated with S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransfer-ase activity. The expression of NP down-regulated genes associated with positive regulation of neu-rogenesis, nervous system development, and heart development. Taken together, the complex tran-scriptomic alterations arising from these viral-host gene interactions offer useful insights into host genes and their pathways that potentially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. © 2021 by the authors.

Meanwhile, identifying biomarkers or indicators is necessary for understanding the severity of the disease and aids in developing efficient drugs and vaccines. Therefore, clinical studies on infected patients revealed that infection-mediated clinical biomarkers, especially proinflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins, are highly associated with COVID-19. These biomarkers are undermined or overlooked in the context of diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of infected patients. Hence, this review discusses the potential implementation of these biomarkers for COVID-19 electrical biosensing platforms. The secretion range for each biomarker is reviewed based on clinical studies. Currently available electrical biosensors comprising electrochemical and electronic biosensors associated with these biomarkers are discussed, and insights into the use of infection-mediated clinical biomarkers as prognostic and adjunct diagnostic indicators in developing an electrical-based COVID-19 biosensor are provided. © 2021 by the authors.

The global financial crisis of 2008 has established the credentials of the Islamic financial system as a sustainable financial system which can save the long run interests of the average citizens around the world while adding value to the real economy. The basic ethical tenets available in the Islamic financial system make it more suited and readymade to fight the economic aftershocks of a pandemic like COVID-19. The basic principles of ethical Islamic finance have solid connections to financial stability and corporate social responsibility within the wide-reaching business context. With the emergence of Financial technology (Fintech) it has provided a missing impetus to the Islamic financial system to compete on equal ground with its conventional counterpart and prove its mettle. The study uses discourse analysis along with the content analysis to extract content and draw a conclusion. The findings of the study indicate that COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for the social and open innovation to grow and finance world have turned to open innovation to provide a speedy, timely, reliable, and sustainable solution to the world. The findings of the study provide significant implications for governments and policy makers in efficient application of Fintech and innovative Islamic financial services to fight the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

"Risk perception of sars-cov-2 infection and implementation of various protective measures by dentists across various countries",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106695417&doi=10.3390%2fijerph18115848&partnerID=40&md5=0887353b3cbf23920faf18067d6ab2d1","Objective: Healthcare workers in general are at a high risk of potential infections with COVID-19, especially those who work with aerosol generating procedures. Dentists fall in this category, as not only do they operate with aerosol generating procedures but also operate within a face-to-face contact area. Methods: A structured self-administered questionnaire was developed at Najran University and provided to the participants for data collection. The data collected included information on risk perception and incorporation of measures for protection against COVID-19 to gauge the attitude of dentists during this period. Also, clinical implementation of various protective measures was reviewed. Results: Of the n = 322 dentists that answered the questions, 50% were general dentists and 28.9% were dentists working at specialist clinics, while the remaining 21.1% of dentists were employed in academic institutions. Among the newer additions to the clinic, 36.3% of dentists answered that they had added atomizers to their practices, followed by 26.4% of dentists that had incorporated the use of UV lamps for sterilization. We found that 18.9% dentists were using HEPA filters in their clinics, while 9.9% of dentists were making use of fumigation devices to control the risk of infection. One-way ANOVA was also carried out to demonstrate that there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.049) between groups of dentists utilizing HEPA filters, UV lamps, atomizers, and fumigation devices to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV2 across their workplaces. Conclusion: Dentists are aware of recently updated knowledge about the modes of transmission of COVID-19 and the recommended infection control measures in dental settings. A better understanding of the situation and methods to prevent it will ensure that the dental community is able to provide healthcare services to patients during the pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

We aimed to evaluate the level of maternal knowledge, perception, and practice during the pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted during the Malaysian Movement Control Order (MCO) between April and June 2020. A self-administered electronic questionnaire that included the knowledge and practice domains was distributed. A newly designed set of questions was used to evaluate (1) women’s perception of MCO and (2) maternal experience, which was subdivided into clinical care provision and maternal anxiety. The survey response rate was 93% with the final number for analysis of 415. The majority of women (95%) demonstrated an adequate level of knowledge on COVID-19, whilst 99% had a good practice. We found that tertiary education (p < 0.001), employment status (p = 0.03), higher household income (p < 0.001), and multiple sources of information (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of adequate maternal knowledge on COVID-19. Women with adequate knowledge also reported a more positive perception of MCO (p < 0.001) and better obstetric care experience (p = 0.037), as did those of Malay ethnicity. Younger (p < 0.001) and nulliparous (p = 0.01) women demonstrated greater anxiety levels. The majority of our women reported good practice and adequate knowledge, which contributed to a positive perception of MCO and better maternal obstetric experience. First-time mothers may benefit from extra support and reassurance during the pandemic to alleviate maternal anxiety. © 2021 by the authors.

Although external CSR activities are better researched, firms’ internal CSR activities such as workplace health promotion and its impact on employee wellbeing are less understood, especially during a pandemic where job security is relatively lower in many sectors of employment. Additionally, wellbeing and good health have been recognized as important targets to achieve as part of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 3. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between healthrelated work benefits and employee wellbeing, satisfaction and loyalty to their workplace. Large scale survey research was performed with responses from 537 employees in Hungary and 16 hypotheses were tested. Data analysis and path modelling using PLS-SEM (Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling) reveal two-layers of factors that impact employee wellbeing, satisfaction and loyalty. We term this as ‘internal locus of control’ and ‘external locus of control’ variables. Internal locus of control variables such as mental and emotional health leads to wellbeing at the workplace but do not directly impact employee satisfaction and loyalty. In contrast, external locus of control factors such as healthcare support leads to wellbeing, satisfaction and loyalty. Employer commitment to healthcare support system is found pertinent especially during the pandemic. We discover wellbeing as a unique standalone construct in this study, which is vital as is it formed by mental and emotional wellbeing of employees, albeit not a determinant of employee workplace satisfaction and loyalty. We theorize workers’ self-reliance and preservation as possible explanations to the disassociation between employee wellbeing and loyalty to workplace during times of crisis and the pandemic. © 2021 by the author.

This study aimed to determine the effect of ACEI/ARB use in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was done in two Saudi public specialty hospitals designated as COVID-19 referral facilities. We included 354 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between April and June 2020, of which 146 were ACEI/ARB users and 208 were non-ACEI/ARB users. Controlling for confounders, we conducted multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching (PSM) and Inverse propensity score weighting (IPSW) for high-risk patient subsets. Results: Compared to non-ACEI/ARB users, ACEI/ARB users had an eight-fold higher risk of developing critical or severe COVID-19 (OR = 8.25, 95%CI = 3.32–20.53); a nearly 7-fold higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR = 6.76, 95%CI = 2.88–15.89) and a nearly 5-fold higher risk of requiring noninvasive ventilation (OR = 4.77,95%CI = 2.15–10.55). Patients with diabetes, hypertension, and/or renal disease had a five-fold higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease (OR = 5.40,95%CI = 2.0−14.54]. These results were confirmed in the PSM and IPSW analyses. Conclusion: In general, but especially among patients with hypertension, diabetes, and/or renal disease, ACEI/ARB use is associated with a significantly higher risk of severe or critical COVID-19 disease, and ICU care. © 2021 The Author(s)","Angiotensin II receptor blocker; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; COVID-19; Disease severity; Hospital admission; Mortality; Saudi Arabia","angiotensin receptor antagonist; azithromycin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; adult; anorexia; antiviral therapy; Article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; drug effect; dyspnea; fatigue; female; fever; heart failure; high risk patient; hospital; hospital admission; human; hypertension; intensive care unit; kidney disease; length of stay; major clinical study; malaise; male; myalgia; noninvasive ventilation; nose obstruction; patient referral; priority journal; propensity score; retrospective study; sore throat; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; COVID-19; Hospitals; Humans; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2"

Data on five air pollutants, namely, PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2, from five monitoring stations located in five regions in Jakarta (West, East, Central, North, and South Jakarta) were utilized. We analyzed the changes in the concentrations of outdoor air pollutants before lockdown from January 1 to April 9, 2020, and during lockdown from April 10 to June 4, 2020. Overall, the CO concentration (39.9%) demonstrated the most significant reduction during lockdown, followed by NO2 (7.5%) and then SO2 (5.7%).

In this study, we conduct a scenario analysis for COVID-19 in Malaysia using a simple universality class of the SIR system and extensions thereof (i.e., the inclusion of temporary immunity through the reinfection problems and limited medical resources scenarios leads to the SIRS-type model). This system has been employed in order to provide further insights on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic. As a case study, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics are investigated using daily confirmed cases in Malaysia, where some of the epidemiological parameters of this system are estimated based on the fitting of the model to real COVID-19 data released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH). We observe that this model is able to mimic the trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and it is possible for transmission dynamics to be influenced by the reinfection force and limited medical resources problems. A rebound effect in transmission could occur after several years and this situation depends on the intensity of reinfection force. Our analysis also depicts the existence of a critical value in reinfection threshold beyond which the infection dynamics persist and the COVID-19 outbreaks are rather hard to eradicate. Therefore, understanding the interplay between distinct epidemiological factors using mathematical modelling approaches could help to support authorities in making informed decisions so as to control the spread of this pandemic effectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Numerical simulation; Reinfection force and limited medical resources; SIRS model","Health risks; Transmissions; COVID-19; Malaysia; Re-infection; Reinfection force and limited medical resource; Scenarios analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Simple++; SIRS models; Transmission dynamics; Universality class; Dynamics; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; critical value; human; Malaysia; outcome assessment; pandemic; priority journal; reinfection; virus transmission; epidemiology; pandemic; reinfection; COVID-19; Humans; Malaysia; Pandemics; Reinfection; SARS-CoV-2"
"QT prolongation associated with hydroxychloroquine and protease inhibitors in COVID-19",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103219165&doi=10.1111%2fjcpt.13356&partnerID=40&md5=a6d511084ab90600d2b0e3f2d95b57b7","What is known and Objective: Hydroxychloroquine and protease inhibitors were widely used as off-label treatment options for COVID-19 but the safety data of these drugs among the COVID-19 population are largely lacking. Drug-induced QTc prolongation is a known adverse reaction of hydroxychloroquine, especially during chronic treatment. However, when administered concurrently with potential pro-arrhythmic drugs such as protease inhibitors, the risk of QTc prolongation imposed on these patients is not known. We aim to investigate the incidence of QTc prolongation events and potential factors associated with its occurrence in COVID-19 population. Methods: We included 446 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients taking at least one treatment drug for COVID-19 within a period of one month (March–April 2020). In addition to COVID-19-related treatment (HCQ/PI), concomitant drugs with risks of QTc prolongation were considered. We defined QTc prolongation as QTc interval of ≥470 ms in postpubertal males, and ≥480 ms in postpubertal females. Results and Discussion: QTc prolongation events occurred in 28/446 (6.3%) patients with an incidence rate of 1 case per 100 person-days. A total of 26/28 (93%) patients who had prolonged QTc intervals received at least two pro-QT drugs. Multivariate analysis showed that HCQ and PI combination therapy had five times higher odds of QTc prolongation as compared to HCQ-only therapy after controlling for age, cardiovascular disease, SIRS and the use of concurrent QTc-prolonging agents besides HCQ and/or PI (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 1.11-24.49; p = 0.036). Independent of drug therapy, presence of SIRS resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 4.3; 95% CI, 1.66-11.06; p = 0.003). In HCQ-PI combination group, having concomitant pro-QT drugs led to four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.53-9.73; p = 0.004). Four patients who had prolonged QTc intervals died but none were cardiac-related deaths. What is new and conclusion: In our cohort, hydroxychloroquine monotherapy had low potential to increase QTc intervals. However, when given concurrently with protease inhibitors which have possible or conditional risk, the odds of QTc prolongation increased fivefold. Interestingly, independent of drug therapy, the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation, leading to the postulation that some QTc events seen in COVID-19 patients may be due to the disease itself. ECG monitoring should be continued for at least a week from the initiation of treatment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","COVID-19; drug interaction; hydroxychloroquine; protease inhibitor; QTc prolongation","enzyme inhibitor; hydroxychloroquine; proteinase inhibitor; adult; cohort analysis; drug therapy; electrocardiography; female; human; long QT syndrome; Malaysia; male; middle aged; retrospective study; Adult; Cohort Studies; COVID-19; Electrocardiography; Enzyme Inhibitors; Female; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Long QT Syndrome; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Protease Inhibitors; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2"

The government rapidly initiated a public health response and provided adequate medical care to manage the public health crisis during the implementation of movement restrictions, starting 18th March 2020, throughout the country. The objective of this study was to investigate the relative efficiency level of managing COVID-19 in Malaysia using network data envelopment analysis. Malaysia state-level data were extracted from secondary data sources which include variables such as total number of confirmed cases, death cases and recovered cases. These variables were used as inputs and outputs in a network process that consists of 3 sub processes i) community surveillance, ii) medical care I and iii) medical care II. A state-level analysis was performed according to low, medium and high population density categories. The efficiency level of community surveillance was highest compared to medical care processes, indicating that the overall inefficiency is greatly influenced by the inefficiency of the medical care processes rather than the community surveillance process. Results showed that high-density category performed well in both community surveillance and medical care II processes. Meanwhile, low-density category performed better in medical care I process. There was a good overall performance of the health system in Malaysia reflecting a strong preparedness and response level to this pandemic.

Therefore, this paper offers a collective insight into the issues affecting construction firms from Covid-19 regarding lockdown rules and the role of 4IR technologies. Given the unexplored nature of the problem, a virtual face-to-face type of qualitative research method was employed. Twelve semi-structured interviews from selected construction firms and consultant experts were engaged and collated data analysed via a thematic approach. Findings group the 4IR technologies into smart construction site, simulation and modelling, and digitisation and virtualisation in Nigeria's context, and majority of the 4IR technologies can be useful to enhance Covid-19 compliance. Reluctant to adopt, high implementation cost, inadequate knowledge management, resistance to change, among others emerged as the factors hindering 4IR technologies usage.

To address these challenges, many digital tools are being explored and developed to contain the spread of the disease. With the lack of availability of vaccines, there is an urgent need to avert resurgence of infections by putting some measures, such as contact tracing, in place. While digital tools, such as phone applications are advantageous, they also pose challenges and have limitations (eg, wireless coverage could be an issue in some cases). On the other hand, wearable devices, when coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT), are expected to influence lifestyle and healthcare directly, and they may be useful for health monitoring during the global pandemic and beyond. In this work, we conduct a literature review of contact tracing methods and applications. Based on the literature review, we found limitations in gathering health data, such as insufficient network coverage. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel intelligent tool that will be useful for contact tracing and prediction of COVID-19 clusters. The solution comprises a phone application combined with a wearable device, infused with unique intelligent IoT features (complex data analysis and intelligent data visualization) embedded within the system to aid in COVID-19 analysis. Contact tracing applications must establish data collection and data interpretation. Intelligent data interpretation can assist epidemiological scientists in anticipating clusters, and can enable them to take necessary action in improving public health management. Our proposed tool could also be used to curb disease incidence in future global health crises. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","contact tracing; coronavirus disease; COVID-19; deep learning; digital tools; intelligent internet of things; wearable devices","Data acquisition; Data visualization; Digital devices; Health; Telephone sets; Wearable technology; Data interpretation; Disease incidence; Health management; Health monitoring; Internet of thing (IOT); Literature reviews; Phone applications; Wireless coverage; Internet of things"

The development and transmission of the disease have increased mortality in all countries. Therefore, a rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is necessary to treat and control the disease. In this paper, a new method for the automatic identification of pneumonia (including COVID-19) is presented using a proposed deep neural network. In the proposed method, the chest X-ray images are used to separate 2–4 classes in 7 different and functional scenarios according to healthy, viral, bacterial, and COVID-19 classes. In the proposed architecture, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used together with a fusion of the deep transfer learning and LSTM networks, without involving feature extraction/selection for classification of pneumonia. We have achieved more than 90% accuracy for all scenarios except one and also achieved 99% accuracy for separating COVID-19 from healthy group. We also compared our deep proposed network with other deep transfer learning networks (including Inception-ResNet V2, Inception V4, VGG16 and MobileNet) that have been recently widely used in pneumonia detection studies. The results based on the proposed network were very promising in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity compared to the other deep transfer learning approaches.

To offer a better understanding for an implementation of multidisciplinary policies in COVID-19 control, we compared the impact of NPIs by assessing the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 in different phases of the epidemic during the first five months in WPR. In this study, we estimated the piecewise instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) and the reporting delay-adjusted case-fatality ratio (dCFR) of COVID-19 in seven WPR jurisdictions: Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Japan, Malaysia, Shanghai, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. According to the results, implementing NPIs was associated with an apparent reduction of the piecewise Rt in two epidemic waves in general. However, large cluster outbreaks raised the piecewise Rt to a high level. We also observed relaxing the NPIs could result in an increase of Rt. The estimated dCFR ranged from 0.09% to 1.59% among the jurisdictions, except in Japan where an estimate of 5.31% might be due to low testing efforts. To conclude, in conjunction with border control measures to reduce influx of imported cases which might cause local outbreaks, other NPIs including social distancing measures along with case finding by rapid tests are also necessary to prevent potential large cluster outbreaks and transmissions from undetected cases. A comparatively lower CFR may reflect the health system capacity of these jurisdictions.

Social distance, self-isolation, and travel restrictions have led to a reduction in the workforce across all economical sectors and have led to a loss of many jobs. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured goods has decreased. On the other hand, the need for medical supplies has increased significantly. The food sector is also facing increased demand as a result of panic buying and storing food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 on the various aspects of the world economy. In Malaysia, the COVID-19 epidemic has checked the resilience of the agriculture sector. Especially the Malaysian paddy industry as country imports 30% of its overall consumption from different parts of the world. The real price of rice triplicating for the consumers, which was alarming for nations in this pandemic situation. The Government of Malaysia introduced the National Agrofood Policy 2011–2020 (NAP4) in 2010 as a guidance document for the implementation of agricultural sector development programs and projects in Malaysia. The NAP4 ‘s 10-year term is to be finished by the end of 2020. Several sectors demonstrate substantial success after approximately 8 years of introduction, while the other classes often lag behind the goal and progress quite slowly. Agricultural sector performance is affected by many problems and challenges. In acknowledgment of the poor success of this field, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Based Industry has launched new approaches, policies, and programs that can change the agricultural sector more rapidly. The new direction is aimed at ensuring national food security and boosting farm and revenues. The authorized government agency needs to revise the policy formulation where Malaysia needs to set stages to revolutionize and modernize the rice farming to address the problem faced by the paddy sector in this pandemic situation to adopt GF. In this study, the researcher focuses on the improvisation of the policy to increase the paddy production sustainably. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","COVID19; GF; Malaysian paddy farmers; Sustainable agricultural practices","agroindustry; alternative agriculture; cause of death; COVID-19; fertilizer application; food security; paddy field; socioeconomic conditions; spatiotemporal analysis; Malaysia"

By affecting the global public health sector, this viral infection has created a disastrous situation associated with high morbidity and mortality rates along with remarkable cases of hospitalization because of its tendency to be high infective. These challenges forced researchers and leading pharmaceutical companies to find and develop cures for this novel strain of coronavirus. Besides, plants have a proven history of being notable wellsprings of potential drugs, including antiviral, antibacterial, and anticancer therapies. As a continuation of this approach, plant-based preparations and bioactive metabolites along with a notable number of traditional medicines, bioactive phytochemicals, traditional Chinese medicines, nutraceuticals, Ayurvedic preparations, and other plant-based products are being explored as possible therapeutics against COVID-19. Moreover, the unavailability of effective medicines against COVID-19 has driven researchers and members of the pharmaceutical, herbal, and related industries to conduct extensive investigations of plant-based products, especially those that have already shown antiviral properties. Even the recent invention of several vaccines has not eliminated doubts about safety and efficacy. As a consequence, many limited, unregulated clinical trials involving conventional mono- and poly-herbal therapies are being conducted in various areas of the world. Of the many clinical trials to establish such agents as credentialed sources of anti-COVID-19 medications, only a few have reached the landmark of completion. In this review, we have highlighted and focused on plant-based anti-COVID-19 clinical trials found in several scientific and authenticated databases. The aim is to allow researchers and innovators to identify promising and prospective anti-COVID-19 agents in clinical trials (either completed or recruiting) to establish them as novel therapies to address this unwanted pandemic. © Copyright © 2021 Alam, Sarker, Afrin, Richi, Zhao, Zhou and Mohamed.","anti-COVID-19; anti-infective; antiviral; Ayurved medicine; bioactive metabolites; phytochemicals; phytomedicine; traditional Chinese medicine","alpha1b interferon; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; anluohuaxian; antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; antiinflammatory agent; antivirus agent; artemic; ayurvedic drug; azithromycin; Brazilian green propolis extract; Caesalpinia spinosa extract; cannabidiol; carrageenan; cephalosporin derivative; Chinese drug; chloroquine; colchicine; colecalciferol; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; corticosteroid; cretan iama; dexamethasone; escin; essential oil; Euterpe oleracea extract; favipiravir; fuzheng huayu; ganlu xiaodu dan; glucocorticoid; Glycyrrhiza glabra extract; herbaceous agent; hesperidin; huoxiang zhengqi; hydroxychloroquine; hypertensive agent; immunoglobulin; immunologic agent; immunomodulating agent; jing guan fang; levofloxacin; lianhua qingwen; lopinavir plus ritonavir; medical cannabis; melatonin; methylprednisolone; monoterpene; moxifloxacin; niaxing shigan; nicotine; nicotine patch; Nigella sativa extract; nutraceutical; Ocimum sanctum extract; oseltamivir; paracetamol; penicillin derivative; phenolic monoterpene; Piper longum extract; placebo; plant extract; plant polyphenol; polyphenol; propolis; qingfei touxie fuzheng; quadramune; quercetin; resistant starch; resveratrol; ribavirin; shenfu; shengmai; shidu yufei; shufeng jiedu; silymarin; Tinospora cordifolia extract; toujie quwen; umifenovir; unclassified drug; Withania somnifera extract; xuebijing; yudu biaofei; zinc; zinc picolinate; add on therapy; adjuvant therapy; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; antiviral activity; Ayurveda; bedtime dosage; Chinese medicine; chronic liver disease; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; drug efficacy; drug safety; evening dosage; familial Mediterranean fever; flu like syndrome; functional food; gout; honey; hospitalization; human; infection prevention; liver disease; mortality rate; nonhuman; oxygen therapy; Review; secondary infection; self care; seroconversion; viral clearance; virus infection; virus load; yoga"

We aimed to evaluate the level of maternal knowledge, perception, and practice during the pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted during the Malaysian Movement Control Order (MCO) between April and June 2020. A self-administered electronic questionnaire that included the knowledge and practice domains was distributed. A newly designed set of questions was used to evaluate (1) women's perception of MCO and (2) maternal experience, which was subdivided into clinical care provision and maternal anxiety. The survey response rate was 93% with the final number for analysis of 415. The majority of women (95%) demonstrated an adequate level of knowledge on COVID-19, whilst 99% had a good practice. We found that tertiary education (p < 0.001), employment status (p = 0.03), higher household income (p < 0.001), and multiple sources of information (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of adequate maternal knowledge on COVID-19. Women with adequate knowledge also reported a more positive perception of MCO (p < 0.001) and better obstetric care experience (p = 0.037), as did those of Malay ethnicity. Younger (p < 0.001) and nulliparous (p = 0.01) women demonstrated greater anxiety levels. The majority of our women reported good practice and adequate knowledge, which contributed to a positive perception of MCO and better maternal obstetric experience.

Due to the scholars’ increasing interest in responding to the urgent call for action against the pandemic, the literature of sustainability research considering COVID-19 consequences is very fragmented. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the COVID-19 implications for sustainability practices is still lacking. This research aims to analyze the effects of COVID-19 on the triple bottom line (TBL) of sustainability to support the future sustainable development agenda. To achieve that, the following research questions are addressed by conducting a systematic literature review: (i) what is the current status of research on the TBL of sustainability considering COVID-19 implications? (ii) how does COVID-19 affect the TBL of sustainability? and (iii) what are the potential research gaps and future research avenues for sustainable development post COVID-19? The results manifest the major implications of the COVID-19 outbreak for the triple sustainability pillars and the sustainable development agenda from the economic, social, and environmental points of view. The key findings provide inclusive insights for governments, authorities, practitioners, and policy-makers to alleviate the pandemic's negative impacts on sustainable development and to realize the sustainability transition opportunities post COVID-19.

This study emphasized the challenges of increased waste disposal during the COVID-19 crisis and its response practices. Data obtained from the scientific research papers, publications from the governments and multilateral organizations, and media reports were used to quantify the effect of the pandemic towards waste generation. A huge increase in the amount of used personal protective equipments (facemasks, gloves, and other protective stuffs) and wide distribution of infectious wastes from hospitals, health care facilities, and quarantined households was found. The amount of food and plastic waste also increased during the pandemic. These factors caused waste treatment facilities to be overwhelmed, forcing emergency treatment and disposals (e.g., co-disposal in a municipal solid waste incinerator, cement kilns, industrial furnaces, and deep burial) to ramp up processing capacity. This paper discussed the ways the operation of those facilities must be improved to cope with the challenge of handling medical waste, as well as working around the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. The study also highlights the need for short, mid, and longer-term responses towards waste management during the pandemic.

In 1999, the Nipah virus outbreak killed 105 Malaysians, while the SARS outbreak of 2003 claimed only 2 lives. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has so far claimed over 100 Malaysian lives. There were two waves of the COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. First wave of 22 cases occurred from January 25 to February 15 with no death and full recovery of all cases. The ongoing second wave, which commenced on February 27, presented cases in several clusters, the biggest of which was the Sri Petaling Tabligh cluster with an infection rate of 6.5%, and making up 47% of all cases in Malaysia. Subsequently, other clusters appeared from local mass gatherings and imported cases of Malaysians returning from overseas. Healthcare workers carry high risks of infection due to the daily exposure and management of COVID-19 in the hospitals. However, 70% of them were infected through community transmission and not while handling patients. In vulnerable groups, the incidence of COVID-19 cases was highest among the age group 55 to 64 years. In terms of fatalities, 63% were reported to be aged above 60 years, and 81% had chronic comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. The predominant COVID-19 strain in Malaysia is strain B, which is found exclusively in East Asia. However, strain A, which is mostly found in the USA and Australia, and strain C in Europe were also present. To contain the epidemic, Malaysia implemented a Movement Control Order (MCO) beginning on March 18 in 4 phases over 2 months, ending on May 12. In terms of economic impacts, Malaysia lost RM2.4 billion a day during the MCO period, with an accumulated loss of RM63 billion up to the end of April. Since May 4, Malaysia has relaxed the MCO and opened up its economic sector to relieve its economic burden. Currently, the best approach to achieving herd immunity to COVID-19 is through vaccination rather than by acquiring it naturally. There are at least two candidate vaccines which have reached the final stage of human clinical trials. Malaysia's COVID-19 case fatality rate is lower than what it is globally; this is due to the successful implementation of early preparedness and planning, the public health and hospital system, comprehensive contact tracing, active case detection, and a strict enhanced MCO. © Copyright © 2021 Hashim, Adman, Hashim, Mohd Radi and Kwan.","coronavirus; COVID-19; Malaysia; movement control order; pandemic","aged; Australia; epidemiology; Europe; Far East; history; human; Malaysia; middle aged; pandemic; Spanish influenza; Aged; Australia; COVID-19; Europe; Far East; History, 20th Century; Humans; Influenza Pandemic, 1918-1919; Malaysia; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2"

Nine metabolites were elevated in plasma and strongly associated with infection (quinolinic acid, glutamic acid, nicotinic acid, aspartic acid, neopterin, kynurenine, phenylalanine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and taurine; p < 0.05), while four metabolites were lower in infection (tryptophan, histidine, indole-3-acetic acid, and citrulline; p < 0.05). This signature supports a systemic metabolic phenoconversion following infection, indicating possible neurotoxicity and neurological disruption (elevations of 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid) and liver dysfunction (reduction in Fischer's ratio and elevation of taurine). Finally, we report correlations between the key metabolite changes observed in the disease with concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines showing strong immunometabolic disorder in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2021 The Authors.

Because of this pandemic, Malaysia government take immediate action to declare Movement Control order (MCO). This MCO gave seriously impact to almost sectors in Malaysia including economic, social and also education sector. We believed that, the students' performance become decrease during MCO. Although classes were continued online, teaching and learning activities are believed less effective than face-to-face classes. This study was conducted to measure the secondary school students' performance during MCO for Mathematics subject. There were 2 set of mathematics score data before and during MCO considered in this study. The independent T-test was conducted to test is there any significant difference of performance between gender for both data sets. Meanwhile, the paired T-test was conducted to evaluate the significant different of student performance before and during MCO. It was found that, there was significant different of students' performance before and during MCO which, the performance during MCO become declined. One of the possible factor that was gave significant effect to the student' performance was lack of effectiveness teaching and learning activities using online platform. So, for future research, a study should be done in order to indicate the significant factor that give effect to students' performance ifteaching and learning activities carried out online. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

The aim of this study was to compare patient-performed testing based on a morning saliva sample with the current standard testing method, healthcare worker-collected sampling via a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). METHODS: This was a prospective single center study which recruited 217 asymptomatic adult male participants in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quarantine center who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 8-10 days prior to isolation. Paired NPS and saliva specimens were collected and processed within 5 hours of sample collection. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting Envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes was performed and the results were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 160 of the 217 (74%) participants tested positive for COVID-19 based on saliva, NPS, or both testing methods. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher in saliva compared to NPS testing (93.1%, 149/160 vs 52.5%, 84/160, P < .001). The concordance between the 2 tests was 45.6% (virus was detected in both saliva and NPS in 73/160), whereas 47.5% were discordant (87/160 tested positive for 1 whereas negative for the other). The cycle threshold (Ct) values for E and RdRp genes were significantly lower in saliva specimens compared to NP swab specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that saliva is a better alternative specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Taking into consideration, the simplicity of specimen collection, shortage of PPE and the transmissibility of the virus, saliva could enable self-collection for an accurate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing. © The Author(s) 2020.

Currently, viable therapeutic options that are cost effective, safe and readily available are desired, but lacking. Nevertheless, the pandemic is noticeably of lesser burden in African and Asian regions, where the use of traditional herbs predominates, with such relationship warranting a closer look at ethnomedicine. From a molecular viewpoint, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the crucial first phase of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Here, we review plants with medicinal properties which may be implicated in mitigation of viral invasion either via direct or indirect modulation of ACE2 activity to ameliorate COVID-19. Selected ethnomedicinal plants containing bioactive compounds which may prevent and mitigate the fusion and entry of the SARS-CoV-2 by modulating ACE2-associated up and downstream events are highlighted. Through further experimentation, these plants could be supported for ethnobotanical use and the phytomedicinal ligands could be potentially developed into single or combined preventive therapeutics for COVID-19. This will benefit researchers actively looking for solutions from plant bioresources and help lessen the burden of COVID-19 across the globe. © Copyright © 2021 Abubakar, Usman, El-Saber Batiha, Cruz-Martins, Malami, Ibrahim, Abubakar, Bello, Muhammad, Gan, Dabai, Alblihed, Ghosh, Badr, Thangadurai and Imam.","ACE2; COVID-19; medicinal plants; renin-angiotensin-system; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; fatty acid; furin; glycoprotein; natural product; transmembrane protease serine 2; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; antiviral activity; binding affinity; cardiovascular system; coronavirus disease 2019; disease burden; drug safety; enzyme activity; genetic variation; geographic distribution; herbal medicine; human; infection prevention; nonhuman; pathophysiology; protein domain; protein protein interaction; protein targeting; receptor binding domain; Review; risk benefit analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; virus entry; virus morphology; virus spike; virus transmission"

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The Malaysian Government announced the restricted activities order known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) nationwide under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 (Amendment) Regulation 2020 from 18 March 2020 to 31 March 2020. With the pandemic still spreading at an alarming rate, hospitals and healthcare workers were overburdened to cope with the sudden influx of large numbers of COVID-19 patients. It was reported that the healthcare workers were ill-equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators to treat the COVIC-19 patients, thus exposing and putting them at risk of infection or losing their lives. The purpose of this study is to provide an insight into the current situation of the ERP for Healthcare Workers. Fortifying a framework for addressing the six stages of ERP will prepare and protect the healthcare workers in performing their duties systematically and address issues and concerns faced by the healthcare workers on the lack of PPE and medical support for COVID-19 treatment. As there is a lack of studies on the improvement of ERP for hospitals, this proposed framework can lead to further research on strengthening the existing ERP for healthcare workers in public hospitals to counter future influenza outbreaks. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

There are a large number of cases and deaths reported each day. The virus that originated from bats has reached pandemic proportions not only in China but also other countries including Europe and Africa. So far, there is no vaccine that can contain the virus. The spread of the virus can have several impacts on the economy, business and society. Malaysia's exports drop, the unemployment rate is on the rise and economic growth shrinks due to the virus. Other than that, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) also fall prey to the virus as most of them have to shut down. Society also faces the need to change their perception and behaviour in order to be accustomed to the government's enforcement. Therefore, the government must play an important role in protecting the economy, business and society. The government has used fiscal policy by giving a stimulus package of RM250 billion.

Many countries have imposed traveling restrictions to reduce people’s movement in order to avoid infection transmission. Traveling restrictions have jeopardized the tourism industry around the globe. If the situation persists, it will become challenging for the nations to open tourism. For this reason, the digitalization of tourism is a viable solution for this situation. However, it is essential to map whether digital technologies can provide alternative solutions to the situation and whether digital tourism can replace conventional tourism? With that backdrop, this study has two objectives: (a) to find the future of digital tourism development beyond the COVID-19 pandemic situation, and (b) to find collaborative research work among nations to develop digital tourism after the current pandemic crisis. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a systematic literature review of past research on the development of digital tourism from 2016–2020. The study applies the PRISMA-2015 statement to select and synthesize 60 articles from Scopus and ‘Web of Science’ databases. Content analysis was performed to analyze the underlying clusters of research on digital tourism and, later, bibliometric analysis was conducted to examine collaborative research between different countries. The findings highlighted three major research clusters namely; virtual reality tourism, virtual tourism, and augmented reality. In addition, the research finding shows that virtual tourism is a practical and valuable option for mass tourism during the COVID-19 outbreak and can replace mass tourism after the pandemic. Although virtual tourism does not feel like a visit to a natural destination, it is still getting attention from tourists. Virtual spaces must develop more features and value additions to achieve tourist satisfaction in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

The odds of higher total turnover score among the fifth-year students was nearly four times that of first-year students (OR = 3.88, 95% CI 2.62–5.73). Perception of the medical profession as not being of high social status and reputation significantly influenced high turnover intention scores (OR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.90–2.68). All three di-mensions of the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) significantly predict turnover intention. Lower scores in the support from Significant Other (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.17– 1.84), Family (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.18–1.83) and Friend (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.14–1.77) subscales were associated with higher turnover intention. Low score in the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was also associated with higher turnover intention (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.17–1.77).

Advancement in the areas of AI, edge computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and fast communication networks provided by beyond 5G (B5G) networks has opened doors for new possibilities by fusing these technologies and techniques. In a pandemic outbreak, such as COVID-19, the need for rapid analysis, decision making, and prediction of future trends becomes paramount. On a global map, the distributed processing and analysis of data at the source is now possible and much more efficient. With the features provided by B5G, such as low latency, larger area coverage, higher data rate, and realtime communication, building new intelligent and efficient frameworks is becoming easier. In this study, our aim is to achieve higher accuracy in prediction by fusing multiple AI methods and leveraging the B5G communication architecture. We propose a distributed architecture for training AI methods on edge devices, with the results of edge-trained models then propagated to a central cloud AI method, which then combines all the received edge-trained models into a global and final prediction model.

An online questionnaire was administered using Google Form distributed via social networks, email lists and social media pages to Malaysian dentists in both private and government sectors. Respondents were required to report their clinical activity during the three phases of the various Movement Control Order (MCO) imposed by the Malaysian government: namely the MCO, Conditional-MCO and the Recovery-MCO. Data was analysed with SPSS using descriptive and Chi-square tests. A total of 1548 dentists completed the survey. Five dentists reported being tested positive for COVID-19 test while 48 had one/more symptoms related to the disease. The majority perceived a real risk of COVID-19 transmission to dentists and more than 80% limited their clinical services to emergency/selective care during the MCO and C-MCO. About 17% of the dentists suspended face-to-face clinical activities during the MCO period but this figure dropped to 3.4% during the R-MCO. Clinical activities were limited mainly due to closure of workplaces (88.6%). Precautionary measures adopted at dental clinics included recording body temperature (54.2%), physical distancing in waiting rooms (84.6%) and hand washing prior to and after dental procedures (77.5%).

Thus, this study was aimed to compare the admission and outcome variables such as number of patient and its severity, acute recanalisation therapy given pre-post COVID-19 at a primary stroke centre located in Malaysia. Methods: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included adult ischaemic stroke patients. Variables of the study included the number of ischaemic stroke patients, the proportions of recanalisation therapies, stroke severity during admission based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, functional outcome at discharge based on the modified Rankin Scale, and relevant workflow metrics. We compared the outcome between two six-month periods, namely the pre-COVID-19 period (March 2019 to September 2019) and the COVID-19 period (March 2020 to September 2020). Results: There were 131 and 156 patients, respectively, from the pre-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period. The median door-to-scan time and the median door-to-reperfusion time were both significantly shorter in the COVID-19 period (24.5 min versus 12.0 min, p = 0.047) and (93.5 min versus 60.0 min, p = 0.015), respectively. There were also significantly more patients who received intravenous thrombolysis (7.6% versus 17.3%, p = 0.015) and mechanical thrombectomy (0.8% versus 6.4%, p = 0.013) in the COVID-19 period, respectively. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic may not have caused disruptions of acute stroke care in our primary stroke centre. Our data indicated that the number of ischaemic stroke events remained stable, with a significant increase of recanalisation therapies and better in-hospital workflow metrics during the COVID-19 pandemic period. However, we would like to highlight that the burden of COVID-19 cases in the study area was very low. Therefore, the study may not have captured the true burden (and relevant delays in stroke patient management) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of the pandemic crisis is ongoing and both pre-hospital and in-hospital care systems must continue to provide optimal, highly time-dependent stroke care services. © 2021 by the authors.

"Estimating direct and spill-over impacts of political elections on COVID-19 transmission using synthetic control methods",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106990046&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pcbi.1008959&partnerID=40&md5=0d2fa2ae644ce70ed11bba50b866820c","Mass gathering events have been identified as high-risk environments for community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Empirical estimates of their direct and spill-over effects however remain challenging to identify. In this study, we propose the use of a novel synthetic control framework to obtain causal estimates for direct and spill-over impacts of these events. The Sabah state elections in Malaysia were used as an example for our proposed methodology and we investigate the event's spatial and temporal impacts on COVID-19 transmission. Results indicate an estimated (i) 70.0% of COVID-19 case counts within Sabah post-state election were attributable to the election's direct effect; (ii) 64.4% of COVID-19 cases in the rest of Malaysia post-state election were attributable to the election's spill-over effects. Sensitivity analysis was further conducted by examining epidemiological pre-trends, surveillance efforts, varying synthetic control matching characteristics and spill-over specifications. We demonstrate that our estimates are not due to pre-existing epidemiological trends, surveillance efforts, and/or preventive policies. These estimates highlight the potential of mass gatherings in one region to spill-over into an outbreak of national scale. Relaxations of mass gathering restrictions must therefore be carefully considered, even in the context of low community transmission and enforcement of safe distancing guidelines. © 2021 Lim et al.

"Depression, anxiety, and the COVID-19 pandemic: Severity of symptoms and associated factors among university students after the end of the movement lockdown",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106962776&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0252481&partnerID=40&md5=a35ebc4ef94c37a2439683eef14549f1","Background and aims This online cross-sectional study investigated the severity of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms among university students and determined the association between various factors and the levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after the movement control order (MCO) was lifted. Methods A total of 316 participants were administered a self-report questionnaire that collected data on sociodemographic attributes, personal characteristics, COVID-19-related stressors, religious coping, and clinical characteristics. In addition, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were administered. Results Regarding depression, 15.5%, 11.7%, and 9.2% of the participants reported mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe depression, respectively. For anxiety, 7.0%, 16.5%, and 13.2% of the respondents had mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe anxiety, respectively. Moreover, 26.3% of participants had mild stress, 9.5% had moderate stress, and 6.6% had severe to extremely severe stress. The multiple linear regression model revealed that frustration because of loss of daily routine and study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated depressive symptoms, while a greater degree of family and friends social support was associated with less depressive symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. It was also found that frustration because of study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated anxiety symptoms, while being enrolled in medicine-based courses and having a greater degree of family support were factors associated with less anxiety symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. Conclusion There is a need to conduct a longitudinal study in the future to confirm the causal relationship between the significant predictive factors and depression and anxiety identified in this study, and maintenance of a persistent flow of academic activities and social interaction may be of utmost importance to safeguard the mental wellbeing of university students. © 2021 Woon et al.

We aimed to determine the response of our paediatric surgical fraternity to a disease that overwhelmingly affects adults. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study over 6 weeks during a federally mandated lockdown. Using snowball sampling, we recruited paediatric surgeons, trainees and medical officers from paediatric surgical units in Malaysia. The anonymous online questionnaire covered sociodemographic information, changes in patient care, redeployment, concerns regarding family members, and impact on training. Mental well-being was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA and multiple regression analysis was used, with significance level 0.05. Results: Of the 129 eligible participants, 100(77%) responded. Junior doctors had clinically higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Age <30 years was significantly associated with anxiety. Junior doctors believed that redeployment led to loss of surgical skills (p<0.001) and trainees felt that clinical application of knowledge had reduced (p<0.020). Conclusion: Specific to our paediatric surgical community, this study highlights areas of concern, particularly among junior doctors. It is likely that recurrent cycles of the pandemic will occur soon. These issues must be addressed to preserve the mental and emotional well-being of all health care workers. © 2021, Malaysian Medical Association.

"Factors affecting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance: an international survey among low-and middle-income countries",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106929800&doi=10.3390%2fvaccines9050515&partnerID=40&md5=4de5730cfb5c5bae88cc176ff78d983a","Vaccination is fast becoming a key intervention against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted cross-sectional online surveys to investigate COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across nine Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs; N = 10,183), assuming vaccine effectiveness at 90% and 95%. The prevalence of vaccine acceptance increased from 76.4% (90% effectiveness) to 88.8% (95% effectiveness). Considering a 90% effective vaccine, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and five African countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Benin, Uganda, Malawi, and Mali) had lower acceptance odds compared to Brazil. Individuals who perceived taking the vaccine as important to protect themselves had the highest acceptance odds (aOR 2.49) at 95% effectiveness.Vaccine acceptance was also positively associated with COVID-19 knowledge, worry/fear regarding COVID-19, higher income, younger age, and testing negative for COVID-19. However, chronic disease and female gender reduced the odds for vaccine acceptance. The main reasons underpinning vaccine refusal were fear of side effects (41.2%) and lack of confidence in vaccine effectiveness (15.1%). Further research is needed to identify country-specific reasons for vaccine hesitancy in order to develop mitigation strategies that would ensure high and equitable vaccination coverage across LMICs. © 2021 by the authors.

Starting from March 18, 2020, the Malaysian government introduced four consecutive phases of a Movement Control Order (MCO) to stem the spread of COVID-19. The MCO was implemented through various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The reported number of cases reached its peak by the first week of April and then started to reduce, hence proving the effectiveness of the MCO. To gain a quantitative understanding of the effect of MCO on the dynamics of COVID-19, this paper develops a class of mathematical models to capture the disease spread before and after MCO implementation in Malaysia. A heterogeneous variant of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model is developed with additional compartments for asymptomatic transmission. Further, a change-point is incorporated to model disease dynamics before and after intervention which is inferred based on data. Related statistical analyses for inference are developed in a Bayesian framework and are able to provide quantitative assessments of (1) the impact of the Sri Petaling gathering, and (2) the extent of decreasing transmission during the MCO period. The analysis here also quantitatively demonstrates how quickly transmission rates fall under effective NPI implementation within a short time period. The models and methodology used provided important insights into the nature of local transmissions to decision makers in the Ministry of Health, Malaysia. Copyright: © 2021 Dass et al.

Methods This study used data from the Global COVID-19 Index provided by PEMANDU Associates. The sample, representing 161 countries, comprised the number of confirmed cases, deaths, stringency indices, population density and GNI per capita (USD). Correlation matrices were computed to reveal the association between the variables at three time points: day-30, day-60 and day-90. Three separate principal component analyses were computed for similar time points, and several standardized plots were produced. Results Confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 showed positive but weak correlation with stringency and GNI per capita. Through principal component analysis, the first two principal components captured close to 70% of the variance of the data. The first component can be viewed as the severity of the COVID-19 surge in countries, whereas the second component largely corresponded to population density, followed by GNI per capita of countries. Multivariate visualization of the two dominating principal components provided a standardized comparison of the situation in the161 countries, performed on day-30, day-60 and day-90 since the first confirmed cases in countries worldwide. Conclusion Visualization of the global spread of COVID-19 showed the unequal severity of the pandemic across continents and over time. Distinct patterns in clusters of countries, which separated many European countries from those in Africa, suggested a contrast in terms of stringency measures and wealth of a country. The African continent appeared to fare better in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic and the burden of mortality in the first 90 days. A noticeable worsening trend was observed in several countries in the same relative time frame of the disease’s first 90 days, especially in the United States of America. © 2021 Teh et al.

Despite large numbers of reported seroprevalence studies, there remains a limited understanding of how the magnitude and epitope utilization of the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 viral anti-gens varies within populations following natural infection. Here, we designed a quantitative, multiepitope protein microarray comprising various nucleocapsid protein structural motifs, including two structural domains and three intrinsically disordered regions. Quantitative data from the microarray provided complete differentiation between cases and pre-pandemic controls (100% sensitivity and specificity) in a case-control cohort (n = 100). We then assessed the influence of disease severity, age, and ethnicity on the strength and breadth of the humoral response in a multi-ethnic cohort (n = 138). As expected, patients with severe disease showed significantly higher antibody titers and interestingly also had significantly broader epitope coverage. A significant increase in antibody titer and epitope coverage was observed with increasing age, in both mild and severe disease, which is promising for vaccine efficacy in older individuals. Additionally, we observed significant differences in the breadth and strength of the humoral immune response in relation to ethnicity, which may reflect differences in genetic and lifestyle factors. Furthermore, our data enabled localization of the immuno-dominant epitope to the C-terminal structural domain of the viral nucleocapsid protein in two independent cohorts. Overall, we have designed, validated, and tested an advanced serological assay that enables accurate quantitation of the humoral response post natural infection and that has revealed unexpected differences in the magnitude and epitope utilization within a population. © 2021 by the authors.

Here we summarize and rationalize the results obtained by various mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approaches applied to the functional characterization of proteins and pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2-mediated infections in humans. Comparative analysis of cell-lines versus tissue samples indicates that our knowledge in proteome profile alternation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still incomplete and the tissue-specific response to SARS-CoV-2 infection can probably not be recapitulated efficiently by in vitro experiments. However, regardless of the viral infection period, sample types, and experimental strategies, a thorough cross-comparison of the recently published proteome, phosphoproteome, and interactome datasets led to the identification of a common set of proteins and kinases associated with PI3K-Akt, EGFR, MAPK, Rap1, and AMPK signaling pathways. Ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2) was identified by 11 studies including all proteomic platforms, suggesting it as a potential future target for SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and the development of new therapeutic strategies.

This study determined the factors that influence health anxiety and its extent in correlations with perceived risk, knowledge, attitude, and practice of HCW. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted on a total of 709 HCW from both public and private healthcare facilities who completed a set of questionnaires on sociodemographic data, knowledge, attitude, and practice of HCW on COVID-19, and health anxiety traits assessed using the short version Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). Multiple linear regression (adjusted R2 = 0.06) revealed respondents with higher perceived risk for COVID-19 significantly predicted higher HAI scores (beta 1.281, p &lt; 0.001, 95%, CI: 0.64, 1.92), and those with a higher cautious attitude towards COVID-19 significantly predicted higher HAI scores (beta 0.686, p &lt; 0.001, 95%CI: 0.35, 1.02). Healthcare workers’ perceived risk and cautious attitude towards COVID-19 might be potentially influenced by management of the sources and approaches to the dissemination of information of the pandemic.

As there are no antiviral agents for the prevention and treatment of this severe pathogen except for remdesivir, development of antiviral therapies to treat infected individuals remains highly urgent. Here, we showed that baicalein and baicalin exhibited significant antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 through in vitro studies. Our data through cell-based and biochemical studies showed that both compounds act as SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors directly and inhibit the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, but baicalein was more potent. We also showed specific binding of baicalein to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, making it a potential candidate for further studies towards therapeutic development for COVID-19 as a selective non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor. © 2021 by the authors.

An abnormal electrocardiogram is associated with poor outcome, and QT prolongation during the illness has been linked to pharmacological effects. This study sought to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 illness on the corrected QT interval (QTc). Method: For 293 consecutive patients admitted to our hospital via the emergency department for COVID-19 between 01/03/20 -18/05/20, demographic data, laboratory findings, admission electrocardiograph and clinical observations were compared in those who survived and those who died within 6 weeks. Hospital records were reviewed for prior electrocardiograms for comparison with those recorded on presentation with COVID-19. Results: Patients who died were older than survivors (82 vs 69.8 years, p < 0.001), more likely to have cancer (22.3% vs 13.1%, p = 0.034), dementia (25.6% vs 10.7%, p = 0.034) and ischemic heart disease (27.8% vs 10.7%, p < 0.001). Deceased patients exhibited higher levels of C-reactive protein (244.6 mg/L vs 146.5 mg/L, p < 0.01), troponin (1982.4 ng/L vs 413.4 ng/L, p = 0.017), with a significantly longer QTc interval (461.1 ms vs 449.3 ms, p = 0.007). Pre-COVID electrocardiograms were located for 172 patients; the QTc recorded on presentation with COVID-19 was longer than the prior measurement in both groups, but was more prolonged in the deceased group (448.4 ms vs 472.9 ms, pre-COVID vs COVID, p < 0.01). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed age, C-reactive protein and prolonged QTc of >455 ms (males) and >465 ms (females) (p = 0.028, HR 1.49 [1.04-2.13]), as predictors of mortality. QTc prolongation beyond these dichotomy limits was associated with increased mortality risk (p = 0.0027, HR 1.78 [1.2-2.6]). Conclusion: QTc prolongation occurs in COVID-19 illness and is associated with poor outcome. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","COVID-19; electrocardiogram; mortality; prolonged QTc; Sars-Cov-2","azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; electrocardiography; female; human; long QT syndrome; male; prognosis; Azithromycin; COVID-19; Electrocardiography; Female; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Long QT Syndrome; Male; Prognosis; SARS-CoV-2"

Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has several advantages over other imaging and detection techniques. Numerous works have been reported on COVID-19 detection from a smaller set of original X-ray images. However, the effect of image enhancement and lung segmentation of a large dataset in COVID-19 detection was not reported in the literature. We have compiled a large X-ray dataset (COVQU) consisting of 18,479 CXR images with 8851 normal, 6012 non-COVID lung infections, and 3616 COVID-19 CXR images and their corresponding ground truth lung masks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest public COVID positive database and the lung masks. Five different image enhancement techniques: histogram equalization (HE), contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), image complement, gamma correction, and balance contrast enhancement technique (BCET) were used to investigate the effect of image enhancement techniques on COVID-19 detection. A novel U-Net model was proposed and compared with the standard U-Net model for lung segmentation. Six different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and ChexNet) and a shallow CNN model were investigated on the plain and segmented lung CXR images. The novel U-Net model showed an accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice coefficient of 98.63%, 94.3%, and 96.94%, respectively for lung segmentation. The gamma correction-based enhancement technique outperforms other techniques in detecting COVID-19 from the plain and the segmented lung CXR images. Classification performance from plain CXR images is slightly better than the segmented lung CXR images; however, the reliability of network performance is significantly improved for the segmented lung images, which was observed using the visualization technique. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and specificity were 95.11%, 94.55%, 94.56%, 94.53%, and 95.59% respectively for the segmented lung images. The proposed approach with very reliable and comparable performance will boost the fast and robust COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chest X-ray images; Convolutional neural networks; COVID-19; Image enhancement; Lung segmentation","Biological organs; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Diseases; Equalizers; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Large dataset; Neural networks; Viruses; Chest X-ray image; Computer-aided; Convolutional neural network; COVID-19; Gamma correction; Histogram equalizations; Lung segmentation; Net model; Performance; Reliable detection; Image enhancement; Article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; histogram; human; image enhancement; image segmentation; major clinical study; priority journal; residual neural network; sensitivity and specificity; thorax radiography; image enhancement; reproducibility; X ray; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Enhancement; Reproducibility of Results; SARS-CoV-2; X-Rays"

We analyzed genetic and clinical data from 97 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Through targeted next-generation-sequencing we found an ADAMTS13 variant in 49 patients, along with two risk factor variants (C3, 21 patients; CFH,34 patients). 31 (32%) patients had a combination of these, which was independently associated with ICU hospitalization (p = 0.022). Analysis of almost infinite variant combinations showed that patients with rs1042580 in thrombomodulin and without rs800292 in complement factor H did not require ICU hospitalization. We also observed gender differences in ADAMTS13 and complement-related variants. In light of encouraging results by complement inhibitors, our study highlights a patient population that might benefit from early initiation of specific treatment. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Complement; COVID-19; Eculizumab; Genetic susceptibility; Rigorous algorithm; SARS-CoV2","complement factor H; complement inhibitor; thrombomodulin; von Willebrand factor cleaving proteinase; ADAMTS13 protein, human; complement component C3; complement factor H; complement factor H, human; THBD protein, human; thrombomodulin; von Willebrand factor cleaving proteinase; adult; Article; clinical outcome; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; female; genetic algorithm; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; high risk patient; high throughput sequencing; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; intensive care; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; sex difference; single nucleotide polymorphism; aged; algorithm; complement activation; genetic predisposition; genetic screening; genetics; intensive care unit; middle aged; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; ADAMTS13 Protein; Aged; Algorithms; Complement Activation; Complement C3; Complement Factor H; COVID-19; Critical Care; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Testing; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Hospitalization; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Thrombomodulin; Thrombotic Microangiopathies"

The infection is caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and clinically characterized by common symptoms including fever, dry cough, loss of taste/smell, myalgia and pneumonia in severe cases. With overwhelming spikes in infection and death, its pathogenesis yet remains elusive. Since the infection spread rapidly, its healthcare demands are overwhelming with uncontrollable emergencies. Although laboratory testing and analysis are developing at an enormous pace, the high momentum of severe cases demand more rapid strategies for initial screening and patient stratification. Several molecular biomarkers like C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL6), eosinophils and cytokines, and artificial intelligence (AI) based screening approaches have been developed by various studies to assist this vast medical demand. This review is an attempt to collate the outcomes of such studies, thus highlighting the utility of AI in rapid screening of molecular markers along with chest X-rays and other COVID-19 symptoms to enable faster diagnosis and patient stratification. By doing so, we also found that molecular markers such as C-reactive protein, IL-6 eosinophils, etc. showed significant differences between severe and non-severe cases of COVID-19 patients. CT findings in the lungs also showed different patterns like lung consolidation significantly higher in patients with poor recovery and lung lesions and fibrosis being higher in patients with good recovery. Thus, from these evidences we perceive that an initial rapid screening using integrated AI approach could be a way forward in efficient patient stratification. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Molecular biomarkers; Multiomics; SARS-CoV-2","antivirus agent; biological marker; C reactive protein; cytokine; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; artificial intelligence; blood; cytology; diagnosis; drug therapy; eosinophil; genetics; human; isolation and purification; lung; mass screening; molecular diagnosis; pathology; procedures; virology; Antiviral Agents; Artificial Intelligence; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Cytokines; Eosinophils; Humans; Interleukin-6; Lung; Mass Screening; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; SARS-CoV-2"

Along with small size vanadium complexes a vanadium-containing derivative of the peptide-like inhibitor N3 (N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-N1-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl] methyl }but-2-enyl)-l-leucinamide) was designed from the crystal structure with PDB entry code 6LU7. On theoretical grounds our consensus docking studies evaluated the binding affinities at the hitherto known binding site of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 for existing and designed vanadium complexes. This main virus protease (Mpro) has a Cys-His dyad at the catalytic site that is characteristic of metal-dependent or metal-inhibited hydrolases. Mpro was compared to the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B) with a comparable catalytic dyad. HPTP1B is a key regulator at an early stage in the signalling cascade of the insulin hormone for glucose uptake into cells. The vanadium-ligand binding site of hPTP1B is located in a larger groove on the surface of Mpro. Vanadium constitutes a well-known phosphate analogue. Hence, its study offers possibilities to design promising vanadium-containing binders to SARS-CoV-2. Given the favourable physicochemical properties of vanadium nuclei, such organic vanadium complexes could become drugs not only for pharmacotherapy but also diagnostic tools for early infection detection in patients.

OBJECTIVE: First, we evaluate the responsiveness and resilience of different chicken and egg farming systems in Myanmar to the shock of COVID-19. Second, we evaluate implications of the performance of the chicken and egg sector during COVID-19 for the Sustainable Development Goals. METHODS: We conducted six waves of telephone interviews from June to November 2020 with 269 chicken farms close to Yangon. We compared impacts in two types of production system - broilers and layers - using a survey of the same farms conducted in 2019 as a baseline. For each type of farm, we compared ‘integrated’ and ‘non-integrated’ farms, where integration involves combining production of chickens and fish. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: First, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted chicken and egg production. More than 30% of broiler farms and 10% of layer farms closed before June, 42% of long-term farmworkers were laid off, and indicators of business sentiment were much more pessimistic than in 2019. Second, the sector experienced a V-shaped recovery until September 2020 when a second wave of COVID-19 hit Myanmar. Third, the impacts of COVID-19 vary by production system. Broiler farms have a much shorter production cycle than layer farms and were able rapidly adjust operational status by closing or reopening, whereas very few layer farms reopened after closing. Fourth, integrated layer-fish farms proved more resilient to the shock of COVID-19 than layer farms, with 90% of layer-fish farms and 76% of layer farms remaining operational in November, but there was no difference in the performance of broiler-fish and broiler farms. Fifth, the slow supply response of layer farms has meant higher egg prices for consumers, likely affecting nutritional intakes and making it more difficult for Myanmar to achieve the second Sustainable Development Goal of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030. SIGNIFICANCE: The results contribute to understanding of the challenges faced by chicken farms in Myanmar during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effectiveness of their adaptive responses. Results have implications for other countries in Asia where integrated livestock-fish farms are common, and other developing countries where the poultry sector is expanding rapidly. © 2021 The Author(s)","Broiler; COVID-19; Integrated chicken-fish; Layer; Myanmar; Resilience","COVID-19; ecosystem resilience; food security; hunger; low income population; malnutrition; poultry; production system; social impact; Sustainable Development Goal; Myanmar; Yangon [Myanmar]; Gallus gallus"
"Convalescent-plasma-transfusion intelligent framework for rescuing COVID-19 patients across centralised/decentralised telemedicine hospitals based on AHP-group TOPSIS and matching component",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099846224&doi=10.1007%2fs10489-020-02169-2&partnerID=40&md5=1aca5a43379b9111db594bef1b161728","As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads across the world, the transfusion of efficient convalescent plasma (CP) to the most critical patients can be the primary approach to preventing the virus spread and treating the disease, and this strategy is considered as an intelligent computing concern. In providing an automated intelligent computing solution to select the appropriate CP for the most critical patients with COVID-19, two challenges aspects are bound to be faced: (1) distributed hospital management aspects (including scalability and management issues for prioritising COVID-19 patients and donors simultaneously), and (2) technical aspects (including the lack of COVID-19 dataset availability of patients and donors and an accurate matching process amongst them considering all blood types). Based on previous reports, no study has provided a solution for CP-transfusion-rescue intelligent framework during this pandemic that has addressed said challenges and issues. This study aimed to propose a novel CP-transfusion intelligent framework for rescuing COVID-19 patients across centralised/decentralised telemedicine hospitals based on the matching component process to provide an efficient CP from eligible donors to the most critical patients using multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. A dataset, including COVID-19 patients/donors that have met the important criteria in the virology field, must be augmented to improve the developed framework. Four consecutive phases conclude the methodology. In the first phase, a new COVID-19 dataset is generated on the basis of medical-reference ranges by specialised experts in the virology field. The simulation data are classified into 80 patients and 80 donors on the basis of the five biomarker criteria with four blood types (i.e., A, B, AB, and O) and produced for COVID-19 case study. In the second phase, the identification scenario of patient/donor distributions across four centralised/decentralised telemedicine hospitals is identified ‘as a proof of concept’. In the third phase, three stages are conducted to develop a CP-transfusion-rescue framework. In the first stage, two decision matrices are adopted and developed on the basis of the five ‘serological/protein biomarker’ criteria for the prioritisation of patient/donor lists. In the second stage, MCDM techniques are analysed to adopt individual and group decision making based on integrated AHP-TOPSIS as suitable methods. In the third stage, the intelligent matching components amongst patients/donors are developed on the basis of four distinct rules. In the final phase, the guideline of the objective validation steps is reported. The intelligent framework implies the benefits and strength weights of biomarker criteria to the priority configuration results and can obtain efficient CPs for the most critical patients. The execution of matching components possesses the scalability and balancing presentation within centralised/decentralised hospitals. The objective validation results indicate that the ranking is valid. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","AHP; Convalescent Plasma; COVID-19; Multi-criteria decision making; Prioritisation; Serological Biomarkers/Protein; TOPSIS","Biomarkers; Blood; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Hospitals; Scalability; Telemedicine; Viruses; Group Decision Making; Hospital management; Management issues; Medical reference; Multicriteria decision making methods; Priority configurations; Technical aspects; Validation results; Intelligent computing"

Institutions, involved in training the next generation of ophthalmologists, are using alternative teaching methods to maintain the standard of education. Methods: We conducted a worldwide survey among physicians, who are actively involved in Ophthalmology-related education, between 3 and 14 April 2020. The expert survey, developed on the basis of literature search and focus group discussions, comprised 23 questions addressing the use of e-learning in Ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 321 participants from both academic and non-academic institutions worldwide, with variable practice experience and expertise, completed the survey. Before the pandemic, the majority of participants used traditional training modalities, including lectures, grand rounds and journal clubs, and 48% did not use any e-learning. There was a statistically significant increase in the use of all e-learning alternatives during the pandemic (p < 0.001), associated mainly with the availability of e-learning facilities (p < 0.001) and the academic character of institutions (p < 0.001). Zoom® was recognized as the mostly used platform for virtual teaching. Although theoretical teaching may take place, the surgical training of residents/fellows was dramatically reduced. The latter was significantly associated with participants’ perspectives about teaching practices (p < 0.001). Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic imposed great challenges in the educational field of Ophthalmology. The experience related to virtual training in Ophthalmology, gained during the pandemic, may change the traditional teaching practices in the world and provide new educational opportunities. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.",,"adult; Africa; Article; Asia; Australia; coronavirus disease 2019; e-learning; educational status; emergency surgery; Europe; female; health care survey; human; male; medical education; Middle East; North America; ophthalmology; pandemic; physician; private practice; residency education; South America; surgical training; teaching; United Kingdom; videoconferencing; curriculum; education; pandemic; COVID-19; Curriculum; Education, Distance; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2"

However, there is limited evidence on suicidal behavior among healthcare workers, an at-risk population. Our study aimed to investigate suicidal ideation in terms of the rate and associated factors in a sample of Malaysian healthcare workers during the early-phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A subpopulation analysis (N = 171) was conducted within a larger, nation-wide cross-sectional study of Malaysian healthcare worker psychological distress from March 18–21, 2020. Current suicidal ideation was measured with item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The following independent variables were assessed: socio-demographic profile, occupation and service-related factors, health-anxiety (Health Anxiety Inventory, HAI), lifetime anxiety disorder and severity of depression (PHQ-9). Results: The proportion of healthcare workers with current suicidal ideation (19/171) and clinical depression (17/171) were 11.1 and 9.9%, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that clinical depression was the most significant factor associated with current suicidal ideation (p < 0.001, OR = 55.983, 95% CI = 9.015–347.671) followed by mild (subthreshold) depression (p = 0.001, OR = 115.984, 95% CI = 2.977–85.804). Service duration of more than 10 years was associated with significantly less suicidal ideation (p = 0.049, OR = 0.072, 95% CI = 0.005–0.993). Conclusions: Depression (subthreshold and especially within the clinical range) and early-career status (<10 years in service) may be target areas of early intervention for reduction of suicidal ideation amongst healthcare workers who have served during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is warranted to elucidate specific occupational stressors related to COVID-19 work conditions to tailor appropriate suicide preventive strategies in this population. © Copyright © 2021 Sahimi, Mohd Daud, Chan, Shah, Rahman and Nik Jaafar.","COVID-19 pandemic; early phase; health-care workers; Malaysia; suicidal ideation","adult; anxiety disorder; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; demography; depression; disease association; disease duration; disease severity; distress syndrome; female; health care personnel; health service; human; independent variable; major clinical study; Malaysian; male; multivariate analysis; occupation; onset age; pandemic; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; population; preliminary data; short health anxiety inventory; socioeconomics; suicidal ideation"

Methods: One week after the announcement of the COVID-19 as a pandemic, in a global survey, 177 addiction medicine professionals described COVID-19-related health responses in their own 77 countries in terms of SUD treatment and harm reduction services. The health responses were categorized around (1) managerial measures and systems, (2) logistics, (3) service providers, and (4) vulnerable groups. Results: Respondents from over 88% of countries reported that core medical and psychiatric care for SUDs had continued; however, only 56% of countries reported having had any business continuity plan, and 37.5% of countries reported shortages of methadone or buprenorphine supplies. Participants of 41% of countries reported partial discontinuation of harm-reduction services such as needle and syringe programs and condom distribution. Fifty-seven percent of overdose prevention interventions and 81% of outreach services were also negatively impacted. Conclusions: Participants reported that SUD treatment and harm-reduction services had been significantly impacted globally early during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our findings, we highlight several issues and complications resulting from the pandemic concerning people with SUDs that should be tackled more efficiently during the future waves or similar pandemics. The issues and potential strategies comprise the following: (1) helping policymakers to generate business continuity plans, (2) maintaining the use of evidence-based interventions for people with SUDs, (3) being prepared for adequate medication supplies, (4) integrating harm reduction programs with other treatment modalities, and (5) having specific considerations for vulnerable groups such as immigrants and refugees. © Copyright © 2021 Radfar, De Jong, Farhoudian, Ebrahimi, Rafei, Vahidi, Yunesian, Kouimtsidis, Arunogiri, Massah, Deylamizadeh, Brady, Busse, ISAM-PPIG Global Survey Consortium, Potenza, Ekhtiari and Baldacchino.","addiction services; COVID-19 pandemic; drug policy; harm reduction; opioid agonist treatment; public health; substance use disorder",

The mental health status of individuals could have a negative impact attributed to this global situation. Therefore, this study was intended to explore the symptoms of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs) of Pakistan during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken by administering a web-based questionnaire between May and June 2020. Two tools, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), were employed to measure anxiety and depression symptoms among HCWs. The data analyses were carried out using descriptive statistics, Man Whitney, and Kruskal Wallis tests. Results: Of 1094 HCWs who participated in this online survey, 742 (67.8%) were physicians, followed by nurses (n = 277, 25.3%) and pharmacists (n = 75, 6.9%). The survey respondents had a median depression and anxiety score of 5.00 (7.00–3.00) and 8.00 (11.00–5.00), respectively. A considerable number of HCWs (82.2%) utilized online psychological resources to deal with their psychological distress. Female HCWs, nurses, frontline HCWs, and HCWs aged 30–49 years were more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety (p < 0.05). Conclusion: During the recent ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, there is a mild level of symptoms of depression and anxiety among HCWs.

The COVID-19 pandemic has no contrast from previous outbreaks like SARS and MERS regarding their ensuing worries and boosted anxiety levels. This article seeks to examine the unique psychological changes that occur in students who have been quarantined inside a university campus and assess sociodemographic factors associated with certain psychological factors. Methodology: The data was collected from students in an Agricultural Campus. In the first phase, the factor structure of the modified National Index Psychological Wellness (NIPW) was acceptable, and to establish statistical parameters for validation an exploratory factor analysis was done. In the second phase, Independent T-tests, ANOVA, and Hierarchical Multiple regression were performed. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0. Result/Discussion: A total of 46 male and 76 female students enrolled in this study. The Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (p < 0.001) and the Kaiser–Mayer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy for the AUDIT-M was 0.901. The Cronbach's alpha of the entire modified NIPW was 0.657 which suggests reasonable internal consistency and subscales between 0.913 and 0.924. Raw scores of 12 positive items were higher for the quarantined group except for “I can do daily routines,” “I understand what happens,” and “I understand the action that is performed is fair.” Raw mean scores of eight negative scoring items were higher in the quarantined group, except for “I feel angry” (2.88 vs. 2.89 for non-quarantined group). There were statistically significant differences between year groups for the questions “I understand what happens,” “I understand the action that is performed is fair,” and “I think everyone is good.” Conclusion: Movement control orders or compulsory quarantine orders can be distressing and may cause understandable psychological sequelae. Holistic management of a quarantine center that addresses the needs and health of an individual student will give a positive impact on psychological wellness. Quarantining facilities can be a place of positivity, allowing people to live a shared experience together, provide peer support for each other, and give each other hope. © Copyright © 2021 Muhamad, Pang, Salvaraji, Rahim, Jeffree and Omar.","Borneo Agricultural Campus; indices of psychological; quarantine status; sociodemographic factors; wellness",

Commercially available serologic tests for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are being performed. The concept of an 'immunity passport' has gained popularity, whereby evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production would signal immunity to reinfection. For an immunity certificate to be validated for travel purposes, it should meet certain criteria. The introduction of such certificates faces multiple challenges. While there may be a future role for immunity passports in limited circumstances in the event that a protective vaccine becomes freely available, for now at least the risks of such an approach outweigh the perceived benefits. © The Author(s) 2020.

This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life (QoL) of Malaysian healthcare workers and its predictive factors. An online sample of 389 university-based healthcare workers completed questionnaires on demographics, clinical features, COVID-19-related stressors, psychological experiences, and perceived social support after the movement lockdown was lifted. All domains of QoL were within the norms of the general population except for social relationship QoL, which was lower than the norm. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that COVID-19-related stressors (e.g., stress due to annual leave being frozen, loss of daily routine, and frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients) and psychological sequelae (e.g., greater severity of depression, anxiety, and stress) predicted lower QoL. Conversely, greater perceived social support from friends and significant others predicted higher QoL. Clinical and demographic characteristics predicted QoL to a lesser extent: A history of pre-existing medical illness was associated only with lower physical health QoL, whereas older age and being single, divorced, or widowed were only predictive of higher environmental QoL. Efforts to enhance QoL among healthcare workers in response to the pandemic should focus on mitigating COVID-19-related stressors and psychological sequelae and facilitating social support. © Copyright © 2021 Woon, Mansor, Mohamad, Teoh and Leong Bin Abdullah.","COVID-19-related stressors; healthcare workers; Malaysia; perceived social support; psychological sequelae; quality of life",

Among them, Internet companies assume a significant part in assisting with uncovering epidemiological information, such as the ""same journey query""platform that can query the public transportation itinerary of patients with pneumonia suspected diagnosis. Citizens can understand their health status and make independent declarations to avoid the spread of immunity. To better understand the requirements, willingness, and elements impacting citizen participation, this study constructs a citizen participation model based on the public service system, combined with the Chinese government's public information interactive management process. Through empirical analysis of the survey data, it is discovered that expectations and perceived quality are the key factors that can significantly affect public participation. It can be concluded that improving the quality of the platform and public expectations will help increase public satisfaction and trust, and ultimately increase public participation. The result is conducive to the better participation of enterprises, governments, and citizens in public information services, and gives insight to future related research. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Diagnosis; Disease control; Information services; Quality control; Chinese Government; Citizen participation; Empirical analysis; Management process; Prevention and controls; Public participation; Public satisfaction; Public transportation; Information management"

As for end-users, DBMS makes it easy to build, read, edit and uninstall data in a database. These days, the databases only treated individual bits of specially formatted files. However, today's databases are more developed, and can accommodate various forms of less formatted data and bind them together in more elaborate ways. Online meat shopping rose during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, more than half of the participants did not choose to order meat goods online because of worries about the spoilage of the meat before the products were shipped. If there was a smartphone monitoring device that helps consumers to monitor food conditions during shipment, 56 percent of participants who did not originally choose to shop online for meat indicated that they would buy meat online. This research has demonstrated that it is very important to incorporate mobile control systems for the stability of the food chain in processes such as pandemics. This study will lead to the development, in the future, of mobile monitoring systems for the food industry. The DBMS handles three main segments, namely the information, the database engine that permits the information to be retrieved, locked and updated, and the database schema that determines the sensible structure of the database. Every one of the three elements help to ensure continuity, confidentiality, data integrity and consistency in data management procedures. Database management functions assisted by the DBMS include change management, performance monitoring and tuning, security, backup and recovery. © 2021 IEEE.","Apps Integration; Covid-19; Online shopping system; Tracking Database system; Web-Development","Chemical contamination; Industrial electronics; Information management; Management information systems; Meats; Ships; Database development; Database management; Management procedures; Management systems; Mobile control systems; Mobile monitoring system; Monitoring device; Performance monitoring; Database systems"

Efficient disease prevention is challenged by factors, such as population growth, insufficient documentation of clinical effects, dissemination mechanism, and lack of a reliable vaccine. Italy was heavily affected by COVID-19, causing it to have one of the highest COVID-19 deaths in the world. Current statistics show that Italy is on its own way to recover from the second wave of the virus. Therefore, this paper presents a susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered-dead (SEIQRD) model to model and predict the spread of the disease in Italy in the near future. The prediction is based on formulating the SEIQRD model using 365-day statistics of the disease. The parameters of the model are estimated using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The modeling results agree well with the reported data, with normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) values ranging from 0.058 to 0.214 (average NMAE = 0.115), and normalized root mean absolute error (NRMSE) values ranging from 0.104 to 0.305 (average NRMSE = 0.190). The estimated PSO-based model is then used to predict the future of the disease in Italy in the coming 35 days. The forecasted results indicate that the number of infections will keep reducing, ending the second wave of COVID-19. Such results can assist governments around the world in the process of planning for countermeasures that help reduce the spread of the disease based on forecasted numbers. © 2021 IEEE.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Forecasting; PSO; SEIQRD","Forecasting; Industrial electronics; Population statistics; Clinical effects; Disease prevention; Mean absolute error; Model results; Modeling and forecasting; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Population growth; World Health Organization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)"

The COVID-19 lockdown could engender disruption to lifestyle behaviors, thus impairing mental wellbeing in the general population. This study investigated whether socio-demographic variables, changes in physical activity, and sleep quality from pre-to during lockdown were predictors of change in mental wellbeing in quarantined older adults. Methods. A 12-week international online survey was launched in 14 languages on 6 April 2020. Forty-one research insti-tutions from Europe, Western-Asia, North-Africa, and the Americas, promoted the survey. The survey was presented in a differential format with questions related to responses “pre” and “during” the lockdown period. Participants responded to the Short Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, and the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results. Replies from older adults (aged &gt;55 years, n = 517), mainly from Europe (50.1%), Western-Asia (6.8%), America (30%), and North-Africa (9.3%) were analyzed. The COVID-19 lockdown led to significantly decreased mental wellbeing, sleep quality, and total physical activity energy expenditure levels (all p &lt; 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the change in total PSQI score and total physical activity energy expenditure (F(2, 514) = 66.41 p &lt; 0.001) were significant predictors of the decrease in mental wellbeing from pre-to during lockdown (p &lt; 0.001, R2: 0.20). Conclusion. COVID-19 lockdown deleteriously affected physical activity and sleep patterns. Furthermore, change in the total PSQI score and total physical activity energy expenditure were significant predictors for the decrease in mental wellbeing. © 2021 by the author.

The current economic downturn is unprecedented and involves many companies and industries that have faced new, previously unknown challenges and threats. The objective of the article is to identify the most important risks and their resources based on the empirical research carried out in small and medium-sized enterprises in Poland. The formulated objective was accomplished using the data collection method, i.e., the survey and reports on the condition of the SME sector in Poland as well as statistical data analysis methods, i.e., structure index and the analysis of variance, using the SPSS system. The process of primary data collection was carried out by means of an electronic survey among selected enterprises of the SME sector, conducting business activities in Poland. In the study, the employment factor was taken into account as a determinant of the perception and assessment of the intensity of selected risks arising from the economic activity in the Polish market in the conditions of the current economic downturn. On the basis of the obtained results, the impact of market, economic, financial and operational risks, depending on their intensity, on the functioning of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises was identified. Based on the analysis of variance, the effect of the size of the company on the level of individual risks was also examined. As a result of the observations made, it was established that, during the pandemic, the level and type of risk is similar in all the surveyed enterprises. They are most often threatened by strong competition in the industry, an increase in energy prices and insufficient profit. The overall results of the empirical research indicate the importance and the need to manage the key threats to the Polish SME sector. © 2021 by the authors.

The symptoms arise within 2 to 14 days after the infection. The specimens are collected from the upper respiratory tract through nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab. This sampling requires close contact with COVID-19 patients and may directly cause transmission to health care professionals. Saliva specimens can be collected easily by asking patients to spit into a sterile container. Materials and Methods: In the current study, the selected patients (n = 20) were those who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to the hospital. After getting approval from ethical committee of the hospital, both nasopharyngeal swab specimens and the salivary samples of each patient were collected and tested using standard procedure of real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The mean cycle threshold values obtained from both the sampling techniques were correlated. It was seen that there was no significant difference between them. The advantage of using saliva as a specimen is in the overall specimen collection procedure and its cost and time effectiveness. The diagnosis of COVID-19 through a rapid test procedure using salivary samples could be a boon to dentists. Conclusion: This would help in the detection of positive asymptomatic carriers of the virus among the patients who come to seek dental treatment and reduce the risk of infection in the dental office. The results of this study clearly show that the values obtained from the two sampling techniques are closely related, and hence saliva could definitely be considered as a diagnostic aid for COVID-19. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

This study was intended to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 among medical students in International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). MATERIAL AND METHOD: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among 438 medical students of IIUM from 6th July 2020 to 9th July 2020. KAP towards COVID-19 was measured using a structured Malay and English version questionnaire consisting of 13 items on knowledge, 3 items on attitudes and 3 items on practices. RESULTS: The average correct response rate on knowledge was 85.4%. Only 12.1% of the students had correct knowledge on all items, and 1 in every 4 and 5 students had misconceptions on the clinical features and transmission of COVID-19. In term of attitudes towards COVID-19, majority of the respondents believed that COVID-19 would be effectively controlled (85%) and had faith that Malaysia could overcome the war against COVID-19 (99%). Most of the respondents practiced good towards COVID-19 in avoiding crowded places (90%), wearing face masks (95%) and practicing hand hygiene (91.6%). CONCLUSION: Although the results are positive towards KAP, only 1 in every 10 students responded correctly to all knowledge questions, and few proportions had misconceptions on the disease and did not maintain adequate practices. Policies aimed at appropriate health promotion activities may ensure empowering the medical students with adequate knowledge on all aspects of COVID-19, and practice properly following the standard operating procedure implemented by the government. © 2021, International Medical Journal Malaysia.

In a recent computational study, we uncovered that mealworm proteins, following in silico gastrointestinal digestion, could be a promising source of peptides that potentially block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. In this study, we furthered our investigation to search for mealworm peptides that potentially target SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, main protease and papain-like protease. Among the 1588 peptide fragments screened, two peptides PKWF and VHRKCF stood out as putative multi-target peptides based on molecular docking analysis. Using in silico tools, we also predicted intermolecular interactions that allow binding of the peptides to the target proteins. Relative importance of the individual residues in the two sequences concerning binding stability to the target proteins was investigated. Physicochemical properties of the peptides were also predicted and discussed in relation to their binding to the targets. Overall, our findings suggest that PKWF and VHRKCF could be potential prophylactic or therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2. We hope that our findings could pave the way for and benefit future discovery of multi-target anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents from insect proteins, particularly from mealworms. © 2021 Malaysian Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

Since then, the virus has claimed millions of lives worldwide. In 29th April 2020, there were more than 5,000 outbreak cases in Malaysia as reported by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOHE). This study aims to evaluate the trend analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak using Mann-Kendall test, and predict the future cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia using Recurrent Forecasting-Singular Spectrum Analysis (RF-SSA) model. The RF-SSA model was developed to measure and predict daily COVID-19 cases in Malaysia for the coming 10 days using previously-confi rmed cases. A Singular Spectrum Analysis-based forecasting model that discriminates noise in a time series trend is introduced. The RF-SSA model assessment is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) offi cial COVID-19 data to predict the daily confi rmed cases after 29th April until 9th May, 2020. The preliminary results of Mann-Kendall test showed a declining trend pattern for new cases during Restricted Movement Order (RMO) 3 compared to RMO1, RMO2 and RMO4, with a dramatic increase in the COVID-19 outbreak during RMO1. Overall, the RF-SSA has over-forecasted the cases by 0.36%. This indicates RF-SSA s competence to predict the impending number of COVID-19 cases. The proposed model predicted that Malaysia would hit single digit in daily confirmed cased of COVID-19 by early-June 2020. These findings have proven the capability of RF-SSA model in apprehending the trend and predict the cases of COVID-19 with high accuracy. Nevertheless, enhanced RF-SSA algorithm should to be developed for higher effectivity in capturing any extreme data changes. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

The mutation involved changes in amino acid sequence of D (aspartic acid) into G (guanine) at position 614. D614G was reported to confer high infectivity and became the dominant form of the virus globally. Interestingly, current evidence found that D614G protein increases its infectivity dependent on the ACE2 receptor, and its co-binding receptor, DPP4. This proclaims implied to COVID-19 high-risk groups; the aging population and the people with comorbidities; hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, which constituted the most of lethal cases, that overexpressed ACE2 and DPP4. The review aims to find an association between COVID-19 infectivity and severity relating to D614G mutation with the expression of ACE2 or DPP4 in these groups. We proposed that D614G mutation and expressions of ACE2 and DPP4 were mutually inclusive for increase infectivity, but not severity in COVID-19 s patients. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

The current pandemic has hurt not only social media users but also on state's sustainable development. As a result, the present study seeks to understand the reasons for using social media during the COVID 19 pandemic by screening various topics and assessing the impact of misinformation on social media, primarily psychological and mental effects. The study utilized a quantitative research design. Participants were individuals between the age of twenty and fifty. Data was collected using a questionnaire shared online to the 360 participants. The studies' responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the arithmetic percentage method using graphs and figures. The study results revealed that many respondents use social media as a source of information, news, and psychological nourishment. Besides, the results indicated that participants below 50 years of age used social media frequently. Whatsapp, Twitter, and Youtube were the most used social media sites among the participants. The findings indicated that most participants used social media as a source of vital information during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study recommends that governments and health institutions focus on developing abilities to respond simultaneously to misinformation cases. This study has facilitated more knowledge into the uses of social media in times of health crises. The study acts as a blueprint to prepare the world for managing social media information sharing in the future. © 2021 WITPress.

This coronavirus has been referred as Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO). The spread of COVID-19 has become unstoppable, infecting around 93.5 million people worldwide, with the infections and deaths still increasing. Today, the entire planet has changed due to the greatest threat on the planet since the introduction of this lethal disease. This pandemic has left the world in turmoil and various measures have been taken by many countries including movement control order or lockdown, to slow down or mitigate the infection. Since the lockdown has been implemented almost in all affected countries, there has been a significant reduction in anthropogenic activity, including a reduction in industrial operations, vehicle numbers, and marine-related activities. All of these changes have also led to some unexpected environmental consequences. As a result of this lockdown, it had a positive and negative impact on the environment including the aquatic environment. Hence this review will therefore focus on the good and bad perspectives of the lockdown toward the aquatic environment. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Massive increment of cases and deaths occurred in China and 209 countries in Europe, America, Australia, Asia and Pakistan. Pakistan was first hit by COVID-19 when a case was reported in Karachi on 26 February 2020. Several methods were presented to model the death rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to forecast the pinnacle of reported deaths. Still, these methods were not used in identifying the first day when Pakistan enters or exits the early exponential growth phase. Objective: The present study intends to monitor variations in deaths and identify the growth phases such as pre-growth, growth, and post-growth phases in Pakistan due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: New approaches are needed that display the death patterns and signal an alarming situation so that corrective actions can be taken before the condition worsens. To meet this purpose, secondary data on daily reported deaths in Pakistan due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered. The $ c$ and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts have been used for monitoring variations. Results: The $ c$-chart shows that Pakistan switches from the pre-growth to the growth phase on 31 March 2020. The EWMA chart demonstrates that Pakistan remains in the growth phase from 31 March 2020 to 17 August 2020, with some indications signaling a decrease in deaths. It is found that Pakistan moved to a post-growth phase for a brief period from 27 July 2020 to 28 July 2020. Pakistan switches to re-growth phase with an alarm on 31/7/2020, right after the short-term post-growth phase. The number of deaths starts decreasing in August in that Pakistan may approach the post-growth phase shortly. Conclusion: This amalgamation of control charts illustrates a systematic implementation of the charts for government leaders and forefront medical teams to facilitate the rapid detection of daily reported deaths due to COVID-19. Besides government and public health officials, it is also the public's responsibility to follow the enforced standard operating procedures as a temporary remedy of this pandemic in ensuring public safety while awaiting a suitable vaccine to be discovered. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Guidance, information and best practices have been characterized by territorial thinking with concentration on national health system and social contexts. Information was to a large extent provided from global entities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others. This bipolar response mechanism came to the detriment of regional and sub-regional levels. The development of the global pandemic was evaluated in terms of the performance of single countries without trying to reflect on possible regional or sub-regional results of similar characteristics in health system and social contexts. To have a clearer view of the issue of sub-regional similarities, we examined the WHO, Eastern Mediterranean Region. When examining the development of confirmed cases for countries in the region, we identified four different sub-groups similar in the development of the pandemic and the social distancing measure implemented. Despite the complicated situation, these groups gave space for thinking outside the box of traditional outbreaks or pandemic response. We think that this sub-regional approach could be very effective in addressing more characteristics and not geographically based analysis. Furthermore, this can be an area of additional conceptual approaches, modelling and concrete platforms for information and lessons learned exchange.

Yet, the question regarding the possible role of these arthropods as SARS-CoV-2 passive/biological transmission vectors is still poorly explored. In this study, we performed in silico structural and binding energy calculations to assess the risks associated with possible ectoparasite transmission. We found sufficient similarity between ectoparasite ACE and human ACE2 protein sequences to build good quality 3D-models of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike:ACE complex to assess the impacts of ectoparasite mutations on complex stability. For several species (e.g., water flea, deer tick, body louse), our analyses showed no significant destabilisation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike:ACE complex, suggesting these species would bind the viral Spike protein. Our structural analyses also provide structural rationale for interactions between the viral Spike and the ectoparasite ACE proteins. Although we do not have experimental evidence of infection in these ectoparasites, the predicted stability of the complex suggests this is possible, raising concerns of a possible role in passive transmission of the virus to their human hosts. © 2021 by the authors.

Although these measures may be successful against COVID-19 transmission, the pandemic and attendant restrictions are a source of chronic and severe stress and anxiety which may contribute to the emergence or worsening of symptoms of eating disorders and the development of negative body image. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to: (1) classify different conditions associated with COVID-19-related stress, COVID-19-related anxiety, and weight status; and (2) analyze and compare the severity of dimensions typically related to eating disorders symptomatology and body image in individuals with different COVID-19-related stress, COVID-19-related anxiety, and weight status. Polish women (N = 671, Mage = 32.50 ± 11.38) completed measures of COVID-19-related stress and anxiety along with body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, and bulimia symptomatology subscales of the Eating Disorders Inventory, and the appearance evaluation, overweight preoccupation, and body areas satisfaction subscales of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. The following four clusters were identified through cluster analysis: (a) Cluster 1 (N = 269), healthy body weight and low COVID-related stress (M = 3.06) and anxiety (M = 2.96); (b) Cluster 2 (N = 154), healthy body weight and high COVID-related stress (M = 5.43) and anxiety (M = 5.29); (c) Cluster 3 (N = 127), excess body weight and high COVID-related stress (M = 5.23) and anxiety (M = 5.35); (d) Cluster 4 (N = 121), excess body weight and low COVID-related stress (M = 2.69) and anxiety (M = 2.83). Our results showed that Clusters 3 and 4 had significantly greater body dissatisfaction and lower appearance evaluation and body areas satisfaction than Clusters 1 and 2. Cluster 3 also had a significantly higher level of drive for thinness, bulimia, and overweight preoccupation than Clusters 1 and 2. These preliminary findings may mean that the COVID-19 pandemic and attendant anxiety and stress caused by the pandemic are exacerbating symptoms of eating disorders and negative body image, with women with excess weight particularly at risk. © 2021 by the authors.

During the initial surge of patients admitted with COVID-19, there was also a corresponding increase in health-care workers (HCWs) detected with COVID-19 infection. The latter being isolated, and the large number of staff members that had come into contact with COVID-19 being quarantined from work, placed further strain on the health-care services. The staff mass screening strategy was a policy decision made by the hospital in response to infection among HCWs, and it aimed to reduce in-hospital transmission (particularly among asymptomatic staff), mitigate workforce depletion due to quarantining, and protect the health-care workforce. In this study, we assessed the detection rate of COVID-19 infection from staff mass testing over a five-week period, and described our experience of adopting this surveillance screening strategy alongside ongoing contact tracing and symptomatic screening strategies. Although it was thought that such periodic staff surveillance might be helpful in protecting the health-care workforce within a short period, the long-term implications, especially in settings with limited resources, is significant and therefore explored in this paper. Our findings might provide an evidence-based reference for the future planning of an optimal strategy with the least compromise in care for a larger proportion of non-COVID-19 patients amid efforts against COVID-19 in a large non-COVID-designated hospital with hybrid status.","COVID-19; healthcare worker; mass screening; Sarawak; surveillance","cross infection; diagnosis; health care personnel; human; infection control; longitudinal study; Malaysia; mass screening; organization and management; practice guideline; procedures; protective equipment; tertiary care center; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Cross Infection; Health Personnel; Humans; Infection Control; Longitudinal Studies; Malaysia; Mass Screening; Personal Protective Equipment; Practice Guidelines as Topic; SARS-CoV-2; Tertiary Care Centers"

We determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), and to determine the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic amongst medical students in Sarawak, Malaysia using the revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R). Methods: We analysed 355 medical student’s data obtained from an online survey. All the undergraduate medical students were the sample population. IBM SPSS version 22.0 was used for data analysis. A p-value of ≤.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Analysis indicated that three-fourths of the students had no mental health issues. More than one-tenth of the students were moderately depressed (12.4%) and 4.3% severely depressed. A similar pattern of prevalence of anxiety was noted with 10% reported moderate anxiety, and 6.8% had severe anxiety. 15.8% of the students had mild stress, 4.2% moderately stressed, and 2% severely stressed. A hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis showed that hyperarousal appeared to be a predictor of depression (β=.466, p<.001), anxiety (β=.481, p<.001) and stress β=.508, p<.001). Along with hyperarousal, intrusion (β=.148, p<.05) predicts stress among the students. Conclusion: Our analysis revealed that hyperarousal symptoms related to the global pandemic of COVID-19 led to significant mental health issues among students. Therefore, urgent strategies to support the students’ psychosocial wellbeing and self-care and to strengthen their coping skills and resilience need to be implemented. © 2021 UPM Press.

The pandemic and measures of its control affect mental health negatively. Self-reported data from 15,375 participants from 23 countries were collected from May to August 2020 during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two questionnaires measuring anxiety level were used in this study—the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI). The associations between a set of social indicators on anxiety during COVID-19 (e.g., sex, age, country, live alone) were tested as well. Self-reported anxiety during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic varied across countries, with the maximum levels reported for Brazil, Canada, Italy, Iraq and the USA. Sex differences of anxiety levels during COVID-19 were also examined, and results showed women reported higher levels of anxiety compared to men. Overall, our results demonstrated that the self-reported symptoms of anxiety were higher compared to those reported in general before pandemic. We conclude that such cultural dimensions as individualism/collectivism, power distance and looseness/tightness may function as protective adaptive mechanisms against the development of anxiety disorders in a pandemic situation. © 2021 by the authors.","Anxiety; Collectivism; COVID-19 pandemic; Cross-cultural; Individualism; Looseness; Power distance; SARS-CoV-2 infection; Stress; Tightness","COVID-19; individualism; mental health; questionnaire survey; Brazil; Canada; Iraq; Italy; United States; SARS coronavirus"

Some low- and middleincome countries have highlighted the challenges with COVID-19 testing, such as inadequate capacity, untrained laboratory personnel, and inadequate funding. This article describes the components and implementation of a healthcare worker surveillance programme in a designated COVID-19 teaching hospital in Malaysia. In addition, the distribution and characteristics of healthcare workers placed under surveillance are described. Material and methods A COVID-19 healthcare worker surveillance programme was implemented in University Malaya Medical Centre. The programme involved four teams: Contact tracing, risk assessment, surveillance and outbreak investigation. Daily symptom surveillance was conducted over fourteen days for healthcare workers who were assessed to have low-, moderate- and high-risk of contracting COVID-19. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted for data collected over 24 weeks, from the 6th of March 2020 to the 20th of August 2020. Results A total of 1,174 healthcare workers were placed under surveillance. The majority were females (71.6%), aged between 25 and 34 years old (64.7%), were nursing staff (46.9%) and had no comorbidities (88.8%). A total of 70.9% were categorised as low-risk, 25.7% were moderate-risk, and 3.4% were at high risk of contracting COVID-19. One-third (35.2%) were symptomatic, with the sore throat (23.6%), cough (19.8%) and fever (5.0%) being the most commonly reported symptoms. A total of 17 healthcare workers tested positive for COVID-19, with a prevalence of 0.3% among all the healthcare workers. Risk category and presence of symptoms were associated with a positive COVID-19 test (p<0.001). Fever (p<0.001), cough (p = 0.003), shortness of breath (p = 0.015) and sore throat (p = 0.002) were associated with case positivity. Conclusion COVID-19 symptom surveillance and risk-based assessment have merits to be included in a healthcare worker surveillance programme to safeguard the health of the workforce. © 2021 Wan et al.

Fever has been observed as one of the most common clinical manifestations, although the prevalence and characteristics of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients is inconclusive. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of fever and chills in addition to fever characteristics (low, medium, and high temperature) in both adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients. Methods The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020176327). PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases were searched between 1st December 2019 and 3rd April 2020 without language restrictions. Both adult (18 years) and paediatric (&lt;18 years) COVID-19 patients were considered eligible. We used random-effects model for the meta-analysis to obtain the pooled prevalence and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Quality assessment of included studies was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and Cochran’s Q test. Robustness of the pooled estimates was checked by different subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Results We identified 2055 studies, of which 197 studies (n = 24266) were included in the systematic review and 167 studies with 17142 adults and 373 paediatrics were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients were 79.43% [95% CI: 77.05–81.80, I2 = 95%] and 45.86% [95% CI: 35.24–56.48, I2 = 78%], respectively. Besides, 14.45% [95% CI: 10.59–18.32, I2 = 88%] of the adult COVID-19 patients were accompanied with chills. In adult COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of medium-grade fever (44.33%) was higher compared to low- (38.16%) and high-grade fever (14.71%). In addition, the risk of both low (RR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.69–3.22, p&lt;0.00001, I2 = 84%) and medium grade fever (RR: 2.79, 95% CI: 2.21–3.51, p&lt;0.00001, I2 = 75%) were significantly higher compared to high-grade fever, however, there was no significant difference between low- and medium-grade fever (RR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.94–1.44, p = 0.16, I2 = 87%). 88.8% of the included studies were of high-quality. The sensitivity analyses indicated that our findings of fever prevalence for both adult and paediatric patients are reliable and robust. Conclusions The prevalence of fever in adult COVID-19 patients was high, however, 54.14% of paediatric COVID-19 patients did not exhibit fever as an initial clinical feature. Prevalence and risk of low and medium-grade fevers were higher compared to high-grade fever. © 2021 Islam et al.

Healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased risk of infection due to occupational exposure to infected patients. We aim to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCW who did not come to medical attention. Methods: We prospectively recruited 400 HCW from the National Public Health Laboratory and two COVID-19 designated public hospitals in Klang Valley, Malaysia between 13/4/2020 and 12/5/2020. Quota sampling was used to ensure representativeness of HCW involved in direct and indirect patient care. All participants answered a self-administered questionnaire and blood samples were taken to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by surrogate virus neutralization test. Findings: The study population comprised 154 (38.5%) nurses, 103 (25.8%) medical doctors, 47 (11.8%) laboratory technologists and others (23.9%). A majority (68.9%) reported exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the past month within their respective workplaces. Adherence to personal protection equipment (PPE) guidelines and hand hygiene were good, ranging from 91-100% compliance. None (95% CI: 0, 0.0095) of the participants had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected, despite 182 (45.5%) reporting some symptoms one month prior to study recruitment. One hundred and fifteen (29%) of participants claimed to have had contact with known COVID-19 persons outside of their workplace. Interpretation: Zero seroprevalence among HCW suggests a low incidence of undiagnosed COVID-19 infection in our healthcare setting during the first local wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The occupational risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within healthcare facilities can be prevented by adherence to infection control measures and appropriate use of PPE. © 2021 The Author(s)",,
"Turning threats into opportunities: how to implement and advance quality TB services for people with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103745365&doi=10.1002%2fjia2.25696&partnerID=40&md5=6632395c4f2637c2a130154d0f0ecde2","Introduction: Until COVID-19, tuberculosis (TB) was the leading infectious disease killer globally, disproportionally affecting people with HIV. The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening the gains made in the fight against both diseases. Discussion: Although crucial guidance has been released on how to maintain TB and HIV services during the pandemic, it is acknowledged that what was considered normal service pre-pandemic needs to improve to ensure that we rebuild person-centred, inclusive and quality healthcare services. The threat that the pandemic may reverse gains in the response to TB and HIV may be turned into an opportunity by pivoting to using proven differentiated service delivery approaches and innovative technologies that can be used to maintain care during the pandemic and accelerate improved service delivery in the long term. Models of care should be convenient, supportive and sufficiently differentiated to avoid burdensome clinic visits for medication pick-ups or directly observed treatments. Additionally, the pandemic has highlighted the chronic and short-sighted lack of investment in health systems and the need to prioritize research and development to close the gaps in TB diagnosis, treatment and prevention, especially for children and people with HIV. Most importantly, TB-affected communities and civil society must be supported to lead the planning, implementation and monitoring of TB and HIV services, especially in the time of COVID-19 where services have been disrupted, and to report on legal, policy and gender-related barriers to access experienced by affected people. This will help to ensure that TB services are held accountable by affected communities for delivering equitable access to quality, affordable and non-discriminatory services during and beyond the pandemic. Conclusions: Successfully reaching the related targets of ending TB and AIDS as public health threats by 2030 requires rebuilding of stronger, more inclusive health systems by advancing equitable access to quality TB services, including for people with HIV, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, services must be rights-based, community-led and community-based, to ensure that no one is left behind. © 2021 The Authors.

Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for RT-PCR and serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 were performed on mortuary and cemetery workers in Qatar. Data on specific job duties, living conditions, contact history, and clinical course were gathered. Environmental sampling was carried out to explore any association with infection. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with infection. Results: Forty-seven mortuary workers provided an NPS and seven (14.9%) were PCR positive; 32 provided a blood sample and eight (25%) were antibody positive, six (75%) who were seropositive were also PCR positive. Among the 81 cemetery workers, 76 provided an NPS and five (6.6%) were PCR positive; 64 provided a blood sample and 22 (34.4%) were antibody positive, three (13.6%) who were seropositive were also PCR positive. Three (22.2%) and 20 (83.3%) of the infected mortuary and cemetery workers were asymptomatic, respectively. Age <30 years (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.7–14.6), community exposure with a known case (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.7–13.3), and presence of symptoms in the preceding 2 weeks (OR 9.0, 95% CI 1.9–42.0) were independently associated with an increased risk of infection (PCR or antibody positive). Of the 46 environmental and surface samples, all were negative or had a Ct value of >35. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of mortuary and cemetery workers had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was incidentally detected upon serologic testing. These data are most consistent with community acquisition rather than occupational acquisition. © 2021 The Author(s)","Cemetery; COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Mortuary; Qatar; SARS-CoV-2","article; cemetery; controlled study; COVID-19 testing; health care personnel; human; morgue; nasopharyngeal swab; polymerase chain reaction; Qatar; adult; diagnosis; female; male; middle aged; occupational disease; posthumous care; prevalence; Qatar; serology; virology; Adult; Cemeteries; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mortuary Practice; Occupational Diseases; Prevalence; Qatar; SARS-CoV-2; Serologic Tests"

The rapid spreading of this virus has led to an exponential increase in the number of cases. It has created a public health disaster, causing a collapse of the health system in every part of the world. Many sectors in the health area are affected, including histopathology services. The challenges and risk of viral transmission can come from various aspects and levels. For COVID-19 tests, there are even cases of no direct contact with the specimens; the specimens received infection from individuals of unknown status. The fixatives used for histopathology specimens are believed to be inactivated viruses, which can be an inactivate coronavirus. Even so, precautions have to be put in place to prevent the spread of infection to laboratory personnel, especially to those handling underfixed and fresh frozen cytology samples. Precautions must also be taken when dealing with histopathology services, by wearing full personal protective equipment and by executing other standard safety measures. The purpose of this review is to highlight the challenges faced in managing histopathology services in our centre during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021","Clinical laboratory services; COVID-19; Pathology","formaldehyde; clinical laboratory service; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 testing; cytology; health care personnel; histology; histopathology; human; human tissue; infection risk; laboratory; laboratory personnel; public health; real time polymerase chain reaction; Review; risk factor; RNA extraction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; specimen handling; virus inactivation; virus transmission"

People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) have concerns about whether they have a higher risk of getting the infection and suffer worse COVID-19 outcomes. Findings from studies on these questions have largely been inconsistent. We aimed to determine the epidemiological characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, blood parameters, and clinical outcomes among PLHIV who contracted COVID-19. Relevant studies were identified through Medline, Cinahl, and PubMed databases. A random-effects model was used in meta-analyses with a 95% confidence interval. Eighty-two studies were included in the systematic review and sixty-seven studies for the meta-analysis. The pooled incidence proportion of COVID-19 among PLHIV was 0.9% (95% CI 0.6%, 1.1%) based on the data from seven cohort studies. Overall, 28.4% were hospitalised, of whom, 2.5% was severe-critical cases and 3.5% needed intensive care. The overall mortality rate was 5.3%. Hypertension was the most commonly reported comorbidity (24.0%). Fever (71.1%) was the most common symptom. Chest imaging demonstrated a wide range of abnormal findings encompassing common changes such as ground glass opacities and consolidation as well as a spectrum of less common abnormalities. Laboratory testing of inflammation markers showed that C-reactive protein, ferritin, and interleukin-6 were frequently elevated, albeit to different extents. Clinical features as well as the results of chest imaging and laboratory testing were similar in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated and non-treated patients. PLHIV were not found to be at higher risk for adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Hence, in COVID-19 management, it appears that they can be treated the same way as HIV negative individuals. Nevertheless, as the pandemic situation is rapidly evolving, more evidence may be needed to arrive at definitive recommendations. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we aimed to analyze the control measures implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as evaluating the responses and outcomes at different phases for epidemic control in Taiwan. (2) Methods: This case study re-viewed responses to COVID-19 and the effectiveness of a range of control measures implemented for epidemic control in Taiwan and assessed all laboratory-confirmed cases between 11 January until 20 December 2020, inclusive of these dates. The confirmation of COVID-19 infection was defined as the positive result of a reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction test taken from a nasopharyngeal swab. Test results were reported by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The incidence rate, mortality rate, and testing rate were compiled, and the risk ratio was provided to gain insights into the effectiveness of prevention measures. (3) Results and Discussion: This study presents retrospective data on the COVID-19 incidence rate in Taiwan, combined with the vital preventive control measures, in a timeline of the early stage of the epidemic that occurred in Tai-wan. The implementation of multiple strategy control measures and the assistance of technologies to control the COVID-19 epidemic in Taiwan led to a relatively slower trend in the outbreak compared to the neighboring countries. In Taiwan, 766 confirmed patients were included, comprised of 88.1% imported cases and 7.2% local transmission cases, within the studied period. The incidence rate of COVID-19 in Taiwan during the studied period was 32 per million people, with a mortality rate of 0.3 per million people. Our analysis showed a significantly raised incidence risk ratio in the countries of interest in comparison to Taiwan during the study period; in the range of 1.9 to 947.5. The outbreak was brought under control through epidemic policies and hospital strategies implemented by the Taiwan Government. (4) Conclusion: Taiwan’s preventive strategies resulted in a drastically lower risk for Taiwan nationals of contracting COVID-19 when new pharmaceutical drug or vaccines were not yet available. The preventive strategies employed by Taiwan could serve as a guide and reference for future epidemic control strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

The required primary data were gathered from the end-users of mHealth in Bangladesh. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), this study has confirmed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, and facilitating conditions have a positive influence on behavioral intention whereas health consciousness has an impact on both intention and actual usage behavior. mHealth usage behavior has an affirmative and meaningful effect on the mental well-being of the service users. Moreover, self-quarantine has strong influence on actual usage behavior but does not moderate the intention-behavior relationship. In addition, due to the existence of a non-linearity problem in the data set, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was engaged to sort out relatively significant predictors acquired from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). However, this study contributes to the emergent mHealth literature by revealing how the use of the mHealth services elevates the quality of patients' mental well-being under this pandemic situation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial neural network; Mental well-being; mHealth; Self-quarantine; UTAUT2","mHealth; Neural networks; Behavioral intention; Coronaviruses; Facilitating conditions; Hedonic motivations; M-health services; Social influence; Structural equation modeling; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Economic and social effects; adult; Article; artificial neural network; Bangladesh; conceptual framework; convergent validity; coronavirus disease 2019; discriminant validity; effort expectancy; facilitating condition; female; habit; health consciousness; hedonic motivation; home quarantine; human; male; performance expectancy; predictor variable; price value; psychological well-being; social influence; structural equation modeling; adolescent; behavior; epidemiology; health behavior; latent class analysis; medical informatics; mental health; middle aged; mobile application; mobile phone; pandemic; patient attitude; psychology; quarantine; questionnaire; telemedicine; therapy; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Bangladesh; Cell Phone; COVID-19; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Intention; Latent Class Analysis; Male; Medical Informatics; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; Young Adult"

To our knowledge, this is the first study that aimed to investigate the psychological distress among the adult general population across 13 countries. This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey by recruiting 7091 respondents. Psychological distress was evaluated with COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). The crude prevalence of psychological distress due to COVID-19 is highest in Vietnam, followed by Egypt, and Bangladesh. Through Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis, the respondents from Vietnam holds the highest level of distress, while the respondents from Sri Lanka holds the lowest level of distress with reference to Nepal.Female respondents had higher odds of having reported psychological distress, and those with tertiary education were less likely to report psychological distress compared to those with lower level of education. The findings indicate that psychological distress is varies across different countries. Therefore, different countries should continue the surveillance on psychological consequences through the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor the burden and to prepare for the targeted mental health support interventions according to the need. The coping strategies and social support should be provided especially to the lower educational attainment group. © 2021 The Author(s)","Coronavirus; COVID-19; COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI); Distress; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychological distress","adult; Article; Bangladesh; controlled study; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; data analysis software; educational status; Egypt; female; health survey; human; India; Indonesia; Iran; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; mental health; mental stress; Myanmar; Nepal; pandemic; peritraumatic distress index; Philippines; population; prevalence; priority journal; psychological rating scale; sex difference; social support; Sri Lanka; structured questionnaire; Thailand; Turkey (republic); Viet Nam"

Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between 12th and May 13, 2020. Quota sampling was used to attain equal gender and age distributions representative of the Japanese population. Results: A total of 4127 complete responses were analysed. Higher educational level (B = 0.045, p = 0.002) and household income (B = 0.04, p = 0.009) were associated with a higher increase in preventive measures when comparing before and after the state of emergency was declared. The highest reported social anxiety was a feeling of fear (65.6%), followed by embarrassment (43.8%), keeping infection a secret (41.3%), avoidance (41.3%), and stigma (25.5%). A total of 86.1% of the respondents reported moderate to severe anxiety. The partial least square-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) revealed that being female has the greatest effect (B = 0.246, p < 0.0001) on higher current preventive measures, followed by social anxiety (B = 0.119; p = 0.001) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores (B = 0.153; p < 0.001). Perceived susceptibility (B = 0.033, p = 0.020), knowing someone who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (B = 0.097, p < 0.001), higher income (B = 0.079, p < 0.001) and educational level (B = 0.045; p = 0.004) all had a small but significant effect on influencing levels of preventive measures. Conclusions: A moderate level of preventive practices found in this study indicates the need to encourage behavioural change to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The provision of mental health services is warranted as anxiety symptoms are prevalent. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anxiety; COVID-19; Japan; Preventive behaviour","adult; age distribution; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; avoidance behavior; behavior assessment; behavior change; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; embarrassment; female; household income; human; infection sensitivity; Japan; major clinical study; male; mental health service; pandemic; priority journal; questionnaire; remission; social phobia; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; stigma; anxiety; middle aged; pandemic; prevalence; social phobia; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Phobia, Social; Prevalence; Young Adult"

Methods: This study analysed cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the PsyCorona Survey that included 54,845 participants from 112 countries, of which 23,278 participants are representative samples of 24 countries in terms of gender and age. Specification curve analysis (SCA) was used to examine associations of risk perception of COVID-19 with emotion and self-rated mental health. This robust method considers all reasonable model specifications to avoid subjective analytical decisions while accounting for multiple testing. Results: All 162 multilevel linear regressions in the SCA indicated that higher risk perception of COVID-19 was significantly associated with less positive or more negative emotions (median standardised β=-0.171, median SE=0.004, P<0.001). Specifically, regressions involving economic risk perception and negative emotions revealed stronger associations. Moreover, risk perception at baseline survey was inversely associated with subsequent mental health (standardised β=-0.214, SE=0.029, P<0.001). We further used SCA to explore whether this inverse association was mediated by emotional distress. Among the 54 multilevel linear regressions of mental health on risk perception and emotion, 42 models showed a strong mediation effect, where no significant direct effect of risk perception was found after controlling for emotion (P>0.05). Limitations: Reliance on self-reported data. Conclusions: Risk perception of COVID-19 was associated with emotion and ultimately mental health. Interventions on reducing excessive risk perception and managing emotional distress could promote mental health. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Emotion; Mental health; Risk perception","adult; aged; Article; attitude to illness; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; disease association; emotion; emotional stress; female; follow up; human; human tissue; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mental health; pandemic; priority journal; response variable; risk management; sensitivity analysis; emotion; mental health; perception; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emotions; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Perception; SARS-CoV-2"

There were 13.0% experienced seizure worsening during COVID-19 period, which were associated with baseline seizures frequency ≥ 1 per month (32.0% vs. 6.2%, p < 0.001), worries of seizure worsening (18.0% vs. 10.9%, p < 0.001), difficulty to go emergency unit (24.4% vs. 10.4%, p < 0.001), AEDs ran out of stock (23.2% vs. 11.6%, p < 0.05), self-adjustment of AED dosages (26.4% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.001), inadequate sleep (22.4% vs. 9.2%, p < 0.001), and stress (23.4% vs.10.1%, p < 0.01). Participants experiencing seizure worsening reported greater anxiety (8.10 ± 5.011 vs. 4.84 ± 3.989, p < 0.001) and depression (6.05 ± 3.868 vs. 3.86 ± 3.589, p < 0.001). Logistic regression showed baseline seizures frequency >1 per month (OR, 14.10) followed by anxiety (OR, 3.90), inadequate sleep (OR, 0.37), and treated in UMMC (OR, 0.31) as the predictors for seizure worsening during COVID-19 period. Poorer total QOLIE-31 score was noted in those with seizure worsening (48.01 ± 13.040 vs. 62.15 ± 15.222, p < 0.001). Stepwise regression highlighted depression as the main negative predictor for quality of life (β = −0.372, p < 0.001), followed by anxiety (β = -0.345, p < 0.001). Conclusion: A significant number of PWE experienced seizure worsening during COVID-19 period, which was related to the clinical, logistic, and psychological factors. Quality of life was affected by the seizure worsening and the psychological stress. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Epilepsy; Quality of life; Seizure control","anticonvulsive agent; adult; anxiety; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; disease exacerbation; emergency ward; epilepsy; female; focal epilepsy; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; major clinical study; male; physiological stress; prediction; psychological aspect; quality of life; quality of life assessment; Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory; seizure; sleep; tonic clonic seizure; complication; epilepsy; middle aged; quality of life; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"

The Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia acts to moderate the spread of COVID-19 through the enacted measures. Furthermore, massive industrial, agricultural activities and human encroachment were significantly reduced following the MCO guidelines. In this study, first, a reconnaissance survey was carried out on the effects of MCO on the health conditions of two urban rivers (i.e., Rivers of Klang and Penang) in Malaysia. Secondly, the effect of MCO lockdown on the water quality index (WQI) of a lake (Putrajaya Lake) in Malaysia is considered in this study. Finally, four machine learning algorithms have been investigated to predict WQI and the class in Putrajaya Lake. The main observations based on the analysis showed that noticeable enhancements of varying degrees in the WQI had occurred in the two investigated rivers. With regard to Putrajaya Lake, there is a significant increase in the WQI Class I, from 24% in February 2020 to 94% during the MCO month of March 2020. For WQI prediction, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) outperformed other models in predicting the changes in the index with a high level of accuracy. For sensitivity analysis results, it is shown that NH3-N and COD play vital rule and contributing significantly to predicting the class of WQI, followed by BOD, while the remaining three parameters (i.e. pH, DO, and TSS) exhibit a low level of importance. © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","COVID-19 pandemic; Movement control operation; Surface water quality; Water quality index","Agricultural robots; Ammonia; Forecasting; Lakes; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Motion estimation; Multilayer neural networks; Rivers; Sensitivity analysis; Water quality; Agricultural activities; Health condition; Movement control; Multi layer perceptron; Reconnaissance surveys; Three parameters; Water quality indexes; World Health Organization; Quality control; COVID-19; lake water; river water; spatiotemporal analysis; surface water; water quality; World Health Organization; Malaysia; Penang; Putrajaya; Putrajaya Lake; West Malaysia"

To date, there are no specific drugs formulated for it, and researchers around the globe are racing against the clock to investigate potential drug candidates. The repurposing of existing drugs in the market represents an effective and economical strategy commonly utilized in such investigations. In this study, we used a multiple-sequence alignment approach for preliminary screening of commercially-available drugs on SARS-CoV sequences from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) isolates. The viral genomic sequences from KSA isolates were obtained from GISAID, an open access repository housing a wide variety of epidemic and pandemic virus data. A phylogenetic analysis of the present 164 sequences from the KSA provinces was carried out using the MEGA X software, which displayed high similarity (around 98%). The sequence was then analyzed using the VIGOR4 genome annotator to construct its genomic structure. Screening of existing drugs was carried out by mining data based on viral gene expressions from the ZINC database. A total of 73 hits were generated. The viral target orthologs were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 KSA isolate sequence by multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTAL OMEGA, and a list of 29 orthologs with purchasable drug information was generated. The results showed that the SARS CoV replicase polyprotein 1a had the highest sequence similarity at 79.91%. Through ZINC data mining, tanshinones were found to have high binding affinities to this target. These compounds could be ideal candidates for SARS-CoV-2. Other matches ranged between 27 and 52%. The results of this study would serve as a significant endeavor towards drug discovery that would increase our chances of finding an effective treatment or prevention against COVID19. © 2021 The Author(s)","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Multiple sequence alignment; Saudi Arabia; Tanshinones",

The main aim of this study is to examine the level of psychological distress during COVID-19 in Bangladesh and explore factors associated with higher psychological distress. Methods: An internet-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2020 in Bangladesh among adults 18 years old and above using structured online questionnaires distributed through emails and other social media throughout Bangladesh with an overall response rate of 34%. Modified version of the Covid19 peritraumatic distress index (CPDI) was used to measure distress. Univariate and Bivariate analysis was used to estimate prevalence of CPDI symptoms and test for the associations between CPDI and the exposure variables. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the odds ratios of our outcome variable by exposure variables. Results: Overall, 44.3% of respondents were suffering from mild to moderate distress and 9.5% were suffering from severe distress. Female respondents were 2.435 times more likely to suffer from CPDI mild to severe distress than males. As compared to Dhaka and Mymensing region of Bangladesh, odds of distress was 1.945 times more in Chittagong/Sylhet region (p-value = 0.035). Conclusion: Large proportion of adult population in Bangladesh are experiencing psychological distress, with level of distress varies by different symptoms and predictors. This study suggest the need to develop comprehensive crisis prevention system including epidemiological monitoring, screening, and referral with targeted intervention to reduce psychological distress. © 2021 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Peritraumatic distress index; Psychological distress","adult; age; Article; Bangladesh; Bangladeshi; coronavirus disease 2019; Covid19 peritraumatic distress index; crisis intervention; cross-sectional study; disease severity; distress syndrome; e-mail; educational status; employment status; epidemiological monitoring; exposure variable; female; health survey; household income; human; Internet; Islam; major clinical study; male; mental stress; outcome variable; overall response rate; pandemic; patient referral; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; scoring system; screening; sex difference; social media; unemployment; young adult"

In particular, in addressing the above challenges, two issues are faced, namely, those related to confidentiality and integrity of their health data and to network failure that may cause concerns about data availability. To the authors’ knowledge, no study provides secure updating and sharing solution for large amounts of healthcare information in communication channels amongst hospitals. Therefore, this study proposes and discusses a novel steganography-based blockchain method in the spatial domain as a solution. The novelty of the proposed method is the removal and addition of new particles in the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. In addition, hash function can hide secret medical COVID-19 data in hospital databases whilst providing confidentiality with high embedding capacity and high image quality. Moreover, stego images with hash data and blockchain technology are used in updating and sharing medical COVID-19 data between hospitals in the network to improve the level of confidentiality and protect the integrity of medical COVID-19 data in grey-scale images, achieve data availability if any connection failure occurs in a single point of the network and eliminate the central point (third party) in the network during transmission. The proposed method is discussed in three stages. Firstly, the pre-hiding stage estimates the embedding capacity of each host image. Secondly, the secret COVID-19 data hiding stage uses PSO algorithm and hash function. Thirdly, the transmission stage transfers the stego images based on blockchain technology and updates all nodes (hospitals) in the network. As proof of concept for the case study, the authors adopted the latest COVID-19 research published in the Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine journal, which presents a rescue framework within hospitals for the storage and transfusion of the best convalescent plasma to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements. The validation and evaluation of the proposed method are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Availability; Blockchain; COVID-19; High capacity; Integrity; Medical data; Particle swarm optimisation; Spatial domain; Steganography","Blockchain; Communication channels (information theory); Embeddings; Hash functions; Health care; Hospitals; Image enhancement; Medical computing; Medical imaging; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Steganography; Connection failures; Data availability; Embedding capacity; Grey scale images; High image quality; Image steganography; Particle swarm optimisation; Secure transmission; Digital storage"

The diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection between healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP + OP) swabs and patient performed self-collected random saliva was assessed. Paired NP + OP swabs and random saliva were collected and processed within 48 h of specimen collection from two cohort studies which recruited 562 asymptomatic adult candidates. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting Open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and nucleocapsid (N) genes was performed and the results were compared. Overall, 65 of 562 (28.1%) candidates tested positive for COVID-19 based on random saliva, NP + OP swabs, or both testing techniques. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in random saliva compared to NP + OP testing (92.3%; 60/65 vs. 73.8%; 48/65; p &lt;.05). The estimated sensitivity and specificity of random saliva were higher than NP + OP swabs (95.0; 99.9 vs. 72.2; 99.4). The Ctvalues of ORF1a and N genes were significantly lower in random saliva compared to NP + OP swabs specimens. Our findings demonstrate that random saliva is an alternative diagnostic specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

A Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented in Malaysia starting from the March 18, 2020 as a pandemic control strategy which restricted all movement and daily outdoor activities. To investigate the impact of MCO, air pollutants: particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) in nine major cities in Malaysia were measured before and during the implementation of the MCO. The non-carcinogenic health risk assessments of the air pollutants are also determined using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Health Risk Assessment method. Overall, NO2 recorded an average percentage reduction of 40% with the highest reduction observed at Kota Kinabalu (62%). The largest reductions of PM10, PM2.5, SO2, O3 and CO were recorded at Kota Kinabalu (17%), Kuantan (9.5%), Alor Star (38%), Kota Bharu (15%), and Ipoh (27%) respectively. All cities had hazard quotient (HQ) values of &lt;1 suggesting no non-carcinogenic health effects. The highest HQ was observed for PM2.5 during the MCO period (4.53E-02) in Kuala Lumpur. An average hazard index (HI) value of 1.44E-01 (before the MCO) and 1.40E-01 (during the MCO) showed higher human health risks before the MCO than during the MCO. This study gives confidence to regulatory bodies that the reduction of human activities significantly reduces air pollution and increases human health and so good air pollution control strategies can provide crucial impacts, especially in reducing air pollution and improving human health. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; COVID-19; Health risk assessment; Malaysia; Movement control order","Aerodynamics; Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Disease control; Environmental Protection Agency; Hazards; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Risk assessment; Sulfur dioxide; Aerodynamic diameters; Air pollution impact; Control strategies; Mitigation measures; Non-carcinogenic health effects; Outdoor activities; Particulate Matter; United states environmental protection agencies; Air pollution control"

Millions of people and businesses have been placed in lockdown where the main aim is to stop the spread of the virus. As an extreme phenomenon, the lockdown has triggered a global economic shock at an alarming pace, conveying sharp recessions for many countries. In the meantime, the lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have drastically changed energy consumption patterns and reduced CO2 emissions throughout the world. Recent data released by the International Monetary Fund and International Energy Agency for 2020 further forecast that emissions will rebound in 2021. Still, the full impact of COVID-19 in terms of how long the crisis will be and how the consumption pattern of energy and the associated levels of CO2 emissions will be affected are unclear. This review aims to steer policymakers and governments of nations toward a better direction by providing a broad and convincing overview on the observed and likely impacts of the pandemic of COVID-19 on the world economy, world energy demand, and world energy-related CO2 emissions that may well emerge in the next few years.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analyses. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify studies published between 1 December 2019 and 23 July 2020. We used random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and Cochran's Q test. Robustness of the pooled estimates was checked by different subgroup and sensitivity analyses This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020183768). Results: We identified 1162 studies, of which 83 studies (n = 27492, 61.4% female) were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients was 47.85% [95% CI: 41.20–54.50]. We observed olfactory dysfunction in 54.40% European, 51.11% North American, 31.39% Asian, and 10.71% Australian COVID-19 patients. Anosmia, hyposmia, and dysosmia were observed in 35.39%, 36.15%, and 2.53% of the patients, respectively. There were discrepancies in the results of studies with objective (higher prevalence) versus subjective (lower prevalence) evaluations. The discrepancy might be due to false-negative reporting observed in self-reported health measures. Conclusions: The prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients was found to be 47.85% based on high-quality evidence. Due to the subjective measures of most studies pooled in the analysis, further studies with objective measures are advocated to confirm the finding.

The spread of COVID-19 has escalated the level of fear among public and nurses. Nevertheless, the mechanism that contributes to minimize the fear towards this pandemic remains unexplored. A cross-sectional survey was adopted to test the relationships among public health education, psychological capital, and fear of COVID-19. In total, 243 responses were obtained via online survey from nurses. The results revealed that public health education can reduce one’s fear of COVID-19. Psychological capital emerged as a strong explanatory mechanism for the phenomenon. Drawing on spillover theory, public health education seems to reduce fear of COVID-19 with the mediating role of psychological capital. Limitations and future directions are at the end of this paper. The study outcomes revealed that organizations should focus on educating nursing staff to overcome fear of COVID-19.

Tens of millions of confirmed cases and more than hundreds of thousands of confirmed deaths are reported worldwide according to the World Health Organisation. News about the virus is spreading all over social media websites. Consequently, these social media outlets are experiencing and presenting different views, opinions and emotions during various outbreak-related incidents. For computer scientists and researchers, big data are valuable assets for understanding people's sentiments regarding current events, especially those related to the pandemic. Therefore, analysing these sentiments will yield remarkable findings. To the best of our knowledge, previous related studies have focused on one kind of infectious disease. No previous study has examined multiple diseases via sentiment analysis. Accordingly, this research aimed to review and analyse articles about the occurrence of different types of infectious diseases, such as epidemics, pandemics, viruses or outbreaks, during the last 10 years, understand the application of sentiment analysis and obtain the most important literature findings. Articles on related topics were systematically searched in five major databases, namely, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and Scopus, from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2020. These indices were considered sufficiently extensive and reliable to cover our scope of the literature. Articles were selected based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic review, with a total of n = 28 articles selected. All these articles were formed into a coherent taxonomy to describe the corresponding current standpoints in the literature in accordance with four main categories: lexicon-based models, machine learning-based models, hybrid-based models and individuals. The obtained articles were categorised into motivations related to disease mitigation, data analysis and challenges faced by researchers with respect to data, social media platforms and community. Other aspects, such as the protocol being followed by the systematic review and demographic statistics of the literature distribution, were included in the review. Interesting patterns were observed in the literature, and the identified articles were grouped accordingly. This study emphasised the current standpoint and opportunities for research in this area and promoted additional efforts towards the understanding of this research field. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Disease mitigation; Epidemic; Infectious disease; Opinion mining; Pandemic; Sentiment analysis","Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Computer scientists; Inclusion and exclusions; Infectious disease; ITS applications; Research fields; Social media platforms; Social media websites; Systematic Review; Diseases"

Currently, the number of active cases in Malaysia is less than 50% of the accumulated points. This paper will present the most accurate machine learning model to predict the number of new possibilities for 01/04-15/04/2020 (15 days). Notably, four machine learning models and one traditional statistical prediction analysis ARIMA have been trained, tested and evaluated. The results are compared to the actual data. We found that the multilayer perceptron neural network has outperformed all models in estimating the number of new positive cases in a specific time range. However, the ARIMA model performs better in predicting recovered and death cases than the machine learning models. We have applied the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute predictive error (MAPE) evaluation metrics to assess the model performance. The proposed approach can be viewed as a feasible alternative to forecast the new COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, where there is no constant seasonal trend and no past data sources for comparison. The proposed methodology is easily tractable and computationally efficient to demonstrate the number of new cases that are useful and beneficial in terms of control management. © 2021 IEEE.","ARIMA; Machine learning; Neural network; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Time-series prediction","Autoregressive moving average model; Forecasting; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Predictive analytics; Computationally efficient; Control management; Evaluation metrics; Feasible alternatives; Machine learning models; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Root mean square errors; Statistical prediction; Machine learning"

Design: A primarily qualitative study has been conducted to evaluate how service providers and recipients were adapting and coping during the initial periods of the COVID-19 response. Settings: The study engaged several healthcare and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the peninsular states of Penang, Kelantan, Selangor, and Melaka. Participants: Medical personnel of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programs (n = 2) and HIV clinics (n = 3), staff of NGO services (n = 4), and MMT patients (n = 9) were interviewed using a semi-structured format. Results: Interviewed participants reported significant organizational, programmatic, and treatment protocols related changes implemented within the healthcare and support services in addition to nationally imposed Movement Control Orders (MCOs). Changes aimed to reduce patient flow and concentration at the on-site services locations, including less frequent in-person visits, increased use of telemedicine resources, and greater reliance on telecommunication methods to maintain contacts with patients and clients; changes in medication dispensing protocols, including increased take-home doses and relaxed rules for obtaining them, or delivery of medications to patients' homes or locations near their homes were reported by the majority of study participants. No significant rates of COVID-19 infections among PWUDs, including among those with HIV have been reported at the study sites. Conclusions: Although the reported changes presented new challenges for both services providers and recipients and resulted in some degree of initial disruption, generally, all participants reported successful implementation and high levels of compliance with the newly introduced restrictions, regulations, and protocols, resulting in relatively low rates of treatment disruption or discontinuation at the study sites. © Copyright © 2021 Vicknasingam, Mohd Salleh, Chooi, Singh, Mohd Zaharim, Kamarulzaman and Chawarski.","COVID-19; HIV; Malaysia; methadone; people who use drugs","amphetamine; benzodiazepine; methadone; methamphetamine; morphine; tetrahydrocannabinol; ambulatory care; Article; clinical article; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; crowding (area); health care access; health care delivery; health care organization; health care utilization; health impact assessment; health service; home care; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection rate; lockdown; Malaysia; medical personnel; methadone treatment; miscellaneous named groups; non-governmental organization; patient compliance; people who use drug; qualitative research; semi structured interview; social adaptation; supportive service; telecommunication; telemedicine"

Desperation within the community, especially among the middle-and low-income groups acutely affected by the economic impact of forced lockdowns, has driven increased interest in exploring alternative choices of medicinal plant-based therapeutics. This is evident with the rise in unsubstantiated efficacy claims of these interventions circulating on social media. Based on enquiries received, our team of researchers was given the chance to produce evidence summaries evaluating the potential of complementary interventions in COVID-19 management. Here, we present and discuss the findings of four selected medicinal plants (Nigella sativa, Vernonia amygdalina, Azadirachta indica, Eurycoma longifolia), with reported antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects that might be interesting for further investigation. Our findings showed that only A. indica reported positive antiviral evidence specific to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on preliminary in silico data while all four medicinal plants demonstrated differential anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory effects. The definitive roles of these medicinal plants in cytokine storms and post-infection complications remains to be further investigated. Quality control and standardisation of medicinal plant-based products also needs to be emphasized.

In the context of high incidence of thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19, supplementation with anticoagulant therapy has been routinely recommended and shown to reduce mortality. However, the recommended type, dose, duration and timing of anticoagulant has not been determined yet. Spontaneous retroperitoneal haematoma secondary to anticoagulant therapy is one of the well-known but self-limiting conditions. We report a 51-year-old COVID-19 positive woman, who was taking intermediate-intensity heparin therapy for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and died from complication of retroperitoneal bleeding. Further studies are needed to verify the risk-benefit ratio of anticoagulant therapy in patients with COVID-19. Although anticoagulant deems appropriate to use in patients with COVID-19, clinicians should be cautious about major bleeding complication such as retroperitoneal haemorrhage even when full therapeutic dosage is not used. © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.

To enhance learning in Science and Mathematics, the repertoire of vocabularies plays a significant role. As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues its spread across the world, people’s vocabulary learning has been limited. Responding to this situation with appropriate awareness, e-learning is being applied to teach the English language. The intent of this study is to utilize Quizizz to enhance the vocabulary achievement among primary English as Second Language (ESL) pupils in rural schools. The study’s research employed mixed methods with purposive sampling of 13 participants. The research site was a rural school located 60km from the nearest town. The data were collected both pre and post-test as designed by the researcher and Likert scale questionnaire. The data was analyzed using appropriate quantitative analysis. To shed more light on the implementation, a thematic analysis by use of a semi-structured interview was conducted. The study finds that 10 out of 13 participants have shown an increase in their post-test of filling in the blank scoring test. The data is strengthened by a moderately high mean score of a Likert scale questionnaire. Furthermore, the participants highlighted that the Quizizz’s leaderboard matched their favored learning style. In this way, this feature tends to evoke a positive learning atmosphere. Thus, it can be concluded that Quizizz could enhance vocabulary achievement among primary English as Secondary Language (ESL) pupils in rural schools. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Asian Online Journal Publishing Group","COVID-19; E-learning; Education; English vocabulary; Quizizz; Rural School",

MCO was introduced in March 2020, and the learning process must switch from face-to-face to online learning in schools and universities. This study particularly focuses on university students by analyzing the students' motivation, the community of inquiry and learning performance. In total, three factors are examined in the construct of the community of inquiry, namely social presence, cognitive presence and teaching presence. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides quantitative analysis and paired sample t-tests on the students' learning motivation, the community of inquiry and learning performance. This paper presents the analysis of the online learning preference of 282 university students and examines whether there is significant difference in preference before and during MCO. Findings: The findings indicated that the students lost motivation and learning performance using online learning methods during the MCO period. There is a lack of infrastructure to support the learning and social support from the lecturers and peers. Research limitations/implications: This research helps to explore improvements that are needed to manage such a pandemic to support teaching staff and students. Practical implications: The COVID-19 is a pandemic that has affected the learning process of the students, and it should not be neglected even when it is over. Policymakers shall consider providing more training and better infrastructures to cater to smooth Internet connection and platform for online learning. Students are not able to focus on learning using online learning methods and, they lack motivation during the pandemic. The teaching faculty also need to be well-trained in delivering online courses and to be more tech-savvy. Social implications: With the detailed analysis of the students' learning motivation, the community of inquiry and learning performance, it helps to promote a better education environment. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the learning motivation and performance model as well as the community of inquiry during the pandemic. It is evident that university students initially have a high level of motivation and community of inquiry before the pandemic but yield a significant drop during the MCO.

The sample is split into two subsample periods: Pre-COVID-19 pandemic and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimated a standard GARCH, GARCH-M, TGARCH, EGARCH and PGARCH model for each subsample. We chose the best GARCH that yielded the lowest Schwarz information criterion for the normal, skewed normal, Student's t-distribution, skewed Student's t-distribution, generalized error distribution (GED) and skewed GED. The results show that both stock market returns are quite persistent, and the persistence decreases for both stock market returns during the pandemic. Furthermore, the normal distribution performed well for Malaysian and Singaporean stock markets before the pandemic and switched to a Student's t (skewed normal) during the pandemic. The standard GARCH(1,1), GARCH-M(1,1), and EGARCH(1,1) performed well for both stock market returns, and the EGARCH indicates the presence of the leverage effect when stock market returns are negatively correlated to its volatility. © 2021 AESS Publications.

However, education should remain welcoming and supportive to all the learners as it is important to keep the students’ behavioural intention in any form of learning environment. Thus, this study is significant as online learning is leading the trend of education now. Past studies revealed that the factors of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions under the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model affect learners’ behavioural intention to use online learning. This study intended to identify the most significant factors that influence TESL postgraduate students’ behavioural intention towards the use of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also examined the relationship amongst the four factors and postgraduate students’ behavioural intention to use online learning. The participants consisted of 169 postgraduate students at a public university in Malaysia. To achieve the aim, the study utilized a survey design using a questionnaire. The results from regression analysis revealed that all of the factors have positive effects on postgraduate students’ behavioural intention to use online learning. Meanwhile, performance expectancy has the greatest influence on postgraduate students’ behavioural intention. Hence, this study concludes that the practicality and the usefulness of online learning should be highlighted by the authorities. © 2021 by the authors.

"Framing twitter public sentiment on Nigerian government COVID-19 palliatives distribution using machine learning",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103101474&doi=10.3390%2fsu13063497&partnerID=40&md5=c68d161ce91902586e2c7e3bdb8b5a07","Sustainable development plays a vital role in information and communication technology. In times of pandemics such as COVID-19, vulnerable people need help to survive. This help includes the distribution of relief packages and materials by the government with the primary objective of lessening the economic and psychological effects on the citizens affected by disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there has not been an efficient way to monitor public funds’ accountability and transparency, especially in developing countries such as Nigeria. The understanding of public emotions by the government on distributed palliatives is important as it would indicate the reach and impact of the distribution exercise. Although several studies on English emotion classification have been conducted, these studies are not portable to a wider inclusive Nigerian case. This is because Informal Nigerian English (Pidgin), which Nigerians widely speak, has quite a different vocabulary from Standard English, thus limiting the applicability of the emotion classification of Standard English machine learning models. An Informal Nigerian English (Pidgin English) emotions dataset is constructed, pre-processed, and annotated. The dataset is then used to classify five emotion classes (anger, sadness, joy, fear, and disgust) on the COVID-19 palliatives and relief aid distribution in Nigeria using standard machine learning (ML) algorithms. Six ML algorithms are used in this study, and a comparative analysis of their performance is conducted. The algorithms are Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistics Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT). The conducted experiments reveal that Support Vector Machine outperforms the remaining classifiers with the highest accuracy of 88%. The “disgust” emotion class surpassed other emotion classes, i.e., sadness, joy, fear, and anger, with the highest number of counts from the classification conducted on the constructed dataset. Additionally, the conducted correlation analysis shows a significant relationship between the emotion classes of “Joy” and “Fear”, which implies that the public is excited about the palliatives’ distribution but afraid of inequality and transparency in the distribution process due to reasons such as corruption. Conclusively, the results from this experiment clearly show that the public emotions on COVID-19 support and relief aid packages’ distribution in Nigeria were not satisfactory, considering that the negative emotions from the public outnumbered the public happiness. © 2021 by the authors.

It was enforced in four phases (i.e., MCO 1, MCO 2, MCO 3 and MCO 4). In this paper, we propose an initiative to assess the impact of MCO by using time-varying reproduction number (Rt). We used data from the Johns Hopkins University Centre for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus repository. Day 1 was taken from the first assumed local transmission of COVID-19. We estimated Rt by using the EpiEstim package and plotted the epidemic curve and Rt. Then, we extracted the mean Rt at day 1, day 5 and day 10 for all MCO phases and compared the differences. The Rt values peaked around day 43, which was shortly before the start of MCO 1. The means for Rt at day 1, day 5, and day 10 for all MCOs ranged between 0.665 and 1.147. The average Rt gradually decreased in MCO 1 and MCO 2. Although spikes in the number of confirmed cases were observed when restrictions were gradually relaxed in the later MCO phases, the situation remained under control with Rt values being stabilised to below unity level (Rt value less than one). © 2021 by the authors.

This has put an enormous pressure on the Malaysian healthcare system. Therefore, the Ministry of Health has come up with the idea of so-called “instant hospitals” to cope with the excessive number of patients, particularly non-critical Covid-19 patients. As a multi-racial country with Islam as the official religion, the Islamic Principles should be considered in the design of “instant hospitals” to promote Islamic awareness, strengthen the commitment to Islam and ultimately gain Allah’s mercy and forgiveness. The implementation of Islamic Principles in the design of these hospitals will enhance the healing process. The objective of this study is to identify the qualified personages to be selected as respondents and the criteria to implement Islamic design quality in an instant hospital or quarantine centre. This study sifts the satisfaction of the respondents on the basis of the criteria related to the implementation of Islamic design quality. This research has utilised the descriptive and survey-based method rooted in qualitative and quantitative research and supported by Media Content Analysis. From the analysis, new Islamic design criteria for hospitals has been outlined, which is consistent with the qualities in the Islamic Built Environment. The results will influence the Malaysian administrators and designers to develop a better hospital environment with the implementation of Islamic quality for the benefit of all the Malaysians.

The vulnerable groups include young children and older adults who were at high risk of infected by this pandemic COVID-19. Those who had recovered from these infections also need to maintain and improves their quality of living. However, there is limited evidence regarding the exercise and physical activity that helps to maintain the overall physical functions. Therefore, this current paper was to map out empirical evidence on exercise prescriptions and physical activity for the prevention and managing the spread of COVID-19 infections. The methodological framework by the TIDIER guidelines were utilized to guide the conduct of MEDLINE complete at EBSCOhost, PubMed, ScienceDirect, CINAHL, Scopus, and Google Scholar. All authors extracted data, summarized the exercise prescription into the relevant concept, and reported the results using a chart and writing a narrative synthesis. Most of the 15 sources that were reviewed reported that the combination of aerobic and strengthening exercise with moderate intensity was considered safe to be performed by individuals under COVID-19 recovery. Moderate intensity indicates effects in enhancing the immune system, preventing cardiorespiratory system problems, and improving the cardiometabolic system. From all kinds of exercises, moderate-intensity is strongly suggested undertaken following the TIDIER guidelines. Moderate-intensity exercise was proven to have positive and safe effects that are recommended for COVID-19 survivors. It is recommended to increase the frequency of exercise from 150-300 to 200-400 minutes per week, including strengthening exercises. © 2021 by SPC (Sami Publishing Company)","Cardiometabolic system; Cardiorespiratory system; COVID-19 survivor; Exercise; Immunity; Physiotherapy",

Method: This was an international cohort study of patients undergoing elective resection of colon or rectal cancer without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Centres entered data from their first recorded case of COVID-19 until 19 April 2020. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic leak, postoperative SARS-CoV-2 and a comparison with prepandemic European Society of Coloproctology cohort data. Results: From 2073 patients in 40 countries, 1.3% (27/2073) had a defunctioning stoma and 3.0% (63/2073) had an end stoma instead of an anastomosis only. Thirty-day mortality was 1.8% (38/2073), the incidence of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 was 3.8% (78/2073) and the anastomotic leak rate was 4.9% (86/1738). Mortality was lowest in patients without a leak or SARS-CoV-2 (14/1601, 0.9%) and highest in patients with both a leak and SARS-CoV-2 (5/13, 38.5%). Mortality was independently associated with anastomotic leak (adjusted odds ratio 6.01, 95% confidence interval 2.58–14.06), postoperative SARS-CoV-2 (16.90, 7.86–36.38), male sex (2.46, 1.01–5.93), age >70 years (2.87, 1.32–6.20) and advanced cancer stage (3.43, 1.16–10.21). Compared with prepandemic data, there were fewer anastomotic leaks (4.9% versus 7.7%) and an overall shorter length of stay (6 versus 7 days) but higher mortality (1.7% versus 1.1%).

The Asian National Cancer Centres Alliance and the Asia-Pacific Organisation for Cancer Prevention collaborated to assess the mid- and long- term impact of COVID-19 to cancer care in Asia. METHODS: The two entities organised a combined symposium and post-meeting interactions among representatives of major cancer centres from seventeen Asian countries to outlining major challenges and countermeasures. RESULTS: Participating stakeholders distilled five big questions. 1) ""Will there be an explosion of late-stage cancers after the pandemic?"" To address and recover from perceived delayed prevention, screening, treatment and care challenges, collaboration of key stakeholders in the region and alignment in cancer care management, policy intervention and cancer registry initiatives would be of essential value. 2) ""Operations and Finance"" The pandemic has resulted in significant material and financial casualties. Flagged acute challenges (shortages of supplies, imposition of lockdown) as well as longer-standing reduction of financial revenue, manpower, international collaboration, and training should also be addressed. 3) ""Will telemedicine and technological innovations revolutionize cancer care?"" Deploying and implementing telemedicine such as teleconsultation and virtual tumour boards were considered invaluable. These innovations could become a new regular practice, leading to expansion of tele-collaboration through collaboration of institutions in the region. 4) ""Will virtual conferences continue after the pandemic?"" Virtual conferences during the pandemic have opened new doors for knowledge sharing, especially for representatives of low- and middle-income countries in the region, while saving time and costs of travel. 5) ""How do we prepare for the next pandemic or international emergency?"" Roadmaps for action to improve access to appropriate patient care and research were identified and scrutinised. CONCLUSION: Through addressing these five big questions, focused collaboration among members and with international organisations such as City Cancer Challenge will allow enhanced preparedness for future international emergencies.<br />.","Asia; Coronavirus; Diagnosis; LMIC; Prevention","Asia; cancer center; communicable disease control; delayed diagnosis; economics; health care delivery; human; neoplasm; organization; organization and management; pathology; telemedicine; videoconferencing; Asia; Cancer Care Facilities; Communicable Disease Control; Congresses as Topic; COVID-19; Delayed Diagnosis; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Neoplasms; SARS-CoV-2; Telemedicine; Videoconferencing"

Capturing important lessons learnt, both positive and negative, is vital. We aimed to document the perceived positive changes (silver linings) in cancer care that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify challenges that may limit their long-term adoption. Methods: This study employed a qualitative design. Semi-structured interviews (n = 20) were conducted with key opinion leaders from 14 countries. The participants were predominantly members of the International COVID-19 and Cancer Taskforce, who convened in March 2020 to address delivery of cancer care in the context of the pandemic. The Framework Method was employed to analyse the positive changes of the pandemic with corresponding challenges to their maintenance post-pandemic. Results: Ten themes of positive changes were identified which included: value in cancer care, digital communication, convenience, inclusivity and cooperation, decentralisation of cancer care, acceleration of policy change, human interactions, hygiene practices, health awareness and promotion and systems improvement. Impediments to the scale-up of these positive changes included resource disparities and variation in legal frameworks across regions. Barriers were largely attributed to behaviours and attitudes of stakeholders. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to important value-based innovations and changes for better cancer care across different health systems. The challenges to maintaining/implementing these changes vary by setting. Efforts are needed to implement improved elements of care that evolved during the pandemic. © the authors;","Barriers; Cancer care; COVID-19; Policy change; Silver linings","Article; awareness; behavior; cancer patient; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; decentralization; decision making; feasibility study; female; health care; health care delivery; health care disparity; health care personnel; health care system; health service; human; low income country; male; malignant neoplasm; middle income country; non communicable disease; palliative therapy; pandemic; public health; qualitative research; semi structured interview"

All had at least one comorbid condition and half were frail. About 19.2% had non-respiratory (atypical) symptoms; 23.1% had a severe disease that required intensive care unit monitoring; 46.2% were given COVID-19 targeted therapy. Inpatient mortality and overall complication rates were 23.1% and 42.3%, respectively. Delirium on presentation and lower Ct-value were associated with mortality. (4) Conclusions: Older people with COVID-19 infection have severe infection and poor hospital outcomes. Vigilant hospital care is necessary to address their multimorbidity and frailty, along with appropriate treatment for their infection. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to measure the level of mental health of the Malaysian public approximately 2 months after the pandemic's onset. Between 12 May and 5 September 2020, an anonymous online survey was conducted. The target group included all members of the Malaysian population aged 18 years and above. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to assess mental health. There were increased depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms throughout the study period, with the depression rates showing the greatest increase. During the end of the data collection period (4 August-5 September 2020), there were high percentages of reported depressive (59.2%) and anxiety (55.1%) symptoms compared with stress (30.6%) symptoms. Perceived health status was the strongest significant predictor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Individuals with a poorer health perception had higher odds of developing depression (odds ratio [OR] = 5.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.81-8.47) and anxiety (OR = 3.50; 95%CI 2.37-5.17) compared with those with a higher health perception. By demographics, young people-particularly students, females and people with poor financial conditions-were more vulnerable to mental health symptoms. These findings provide an urgent call for increased attention to detect and provide intervention strategies to combat the increasing rate of mental health problems in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the pandemic on mental health and quality of life among the general population in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. A total of 6142 adults from eighteen countries within the MENA region completed an online questionnaire between May and June 2020. Psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the social and family support impact was assessed with questions from the Perceived Support Scale (PSS). The IES-R mean score was 29.3 (SD = 14.8), corresponding to mild stressful impact with 30.9% reporting severe psychological impact. Most participants (45%-62%) felt horrified, apprehensive, or helpless due to COVID-19. Furthermore, over 40% reported increased stress from work and financial matters. Higher IES-R scores were found among females, participants aged 26-35 years, those with lower educational level, and participants residing in the North Africa region (p<0.005). About 42% reported receiving increased support from family members, 40.5% were paying more attention to their mental health, and over 40% reported spending more time resting since the pandemic started. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mild psychological impact while it also encouraged some positive impact on family support and mental health awareness among adults in the MENA region.

This study aimed to examine stress, anxiety, and depression among healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients in Sarawak General Hospital (SGH), Malaysia. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional observational study conducted in SGH during the pandemic with an online self-administered questionnaire composed of two parts, the socio-demographic characteristics, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). Results: A total of 105 healthcare workers responded to this study. A questionnaire in both Bahasa Melayu and English was used. The findings showed that all healthcare workers had mild anxiety, with the majority experiencing mild stress (57.1%), and almost half of the respondents experiencing mild depression (41%). Female subjects had a significant higher mean score in anxiety level and stress level compared to male subjects (10.0±3.20 vs. 8.6±2.93, p<0.05; 14.1±4.76 vs. 10.7±3.70, p<0.05, respectively). Staff who were transferred from other units to handle COVID-19 cases experienced more psychological symptoms. There were significant correlations between the depression, anxiety and stress levels among the healthcare workers and the number of children they had (r=0.739, p=0.001; r=0.642, p=0.001; r=1, p =0.001 respectively). However, the stress level among the healthcare workers was reversely correlated with their years of working experience (r=-0.199, p=0.042). Conclusion: This study identified some socio-demographic factors associated with increased levels of stress, anxiety and depression among the healthcare workers during pandemic, which may lay ground for future interventions. © 2021, Malaysian Medical Association.

We aim to explore the corrected QT (QTc) interval and ‘torsadogenic’ potential of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir utilising a combination of smartphone electrocardiogram and 12-lead electrocardiogram monitoring. Materials and Methods: Between 16-April-2020 to 30-April- 2020, patients with suspected or confirmed for COVID-19 indicated for in-patient treatment with hydroxychloroquine with or without lopinavir-ritonavir to the Sarawak General Hospital were monitored with KardiaMobile smartphone electrocardiogram (AliveCor®, Mountain View, CA) or standard 12-lead electrocardiogram. The baseline and serial QTc intervals were monitored till the last dose of medications or until the normalization of the QTc interval. Results: Thirty patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine, and 20 (66.7%) patients received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir therapy. The maximum QTc interval was significantly prolonged compared to baseline (434.6±28.2msec vs. 458.6±47.1msec, p=0.001). The maximum QTc interval (456.1±45.7msec vs. 464.6±45.2msec, p=0.635) and the delta QTc (32.6±38.5msec vs. 26.3±35.8msec, p=0.658) were not significantly different between patients on hydroxychloroquine or a combination of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir. Five (16.7%) patients had QTc of 500msec or more. Four (13.3%) patients required discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine and 3 (10.0%) patients required discontinuation of lopinavir- ritonavir due to QTc prolongation. However, no torsade de pointes was observed. Conclusions: QTc monitoring using smartphone electrocardiogram was feasible in COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine with or without lopinavir-ritonavir. The usage of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir resulted in QTc prolongation, but no torsade de pointes or arrhythmogenic death was observed. © 2021, Malaysian Medical Association.

Materials and Methods: Chest radiographs of patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Hospital Tawau, Sabah, Malaysia were retrospectively analyzed by two radiologists. The radiographic pattern, distribution among subgroups and evolution of the disease over time were determined. Results: Among the 82 patients studied, 65 (79.3%) were males. Mean age of our cohorts was 37 ± 15 years. Baseline chest radiographs were abnormal in 37 patients (45.1%). Over half (52.9%) of the symptomatic patients had abnormal baseline radiograph. Among the children, patients with comorbidities, and patients 60 years of age and above, the abnormal radiographs were 14.3%, 71.4% and 69.3% respectively. Ground glass opacities were the commonest abnormal radiographic feature (35.4%), were peripherally located (35.4%) with predilection for the lower zones (29.3%). Most radiographic abnormalities were multifocal (20.7%) and frequently located in the left lung (19.5%). Radiographic recovery was observed in 15 of 18 patients (83%). Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated greater extent of the disease than observed in radiographs of the same patient. Conclusions: COVID-19 pneumonia presented with a specific radiographic pattern in our cohort of patients, comprising of ground glass opacities in peripheral and basilar distribution, affecting a single lung field and was observed in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.

For example, food security is one vital aspect of food systems which is directly affected. This review summarizes food security during epidemics and pandemics before moving on to panic buying, food shortages, and price spikes observed during the current crisis. The importance of food resilience, together with the need for addressing issues related to food loss and food waste, is underlined in the review towards food security and sustainable development. As a result, the pandemic has shown that our food systems are fragile. Since the global population and urbanization will grow in the coming decades, pandemics will likely occur more often, and climate change will intensify. Consequently, there is a need to ensure that our food systems become more sustainable and resilient. To that end, we have highlighted the need to develop contingency plans and mitigation strategies that would allow a more rapid response to extreme events (e.g., disasters from climate change) and transform the food sector by making it more resilient. © 2021 by the authors.

The model was tested using data collected from 259 employees in Malaysia. Results of path modeling analysis revealed significant impacts of self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and family and friends’ support on employees’ resilience. Besides, resilience was significantly associated with job engagement. Our findings suggest that management concerns for employees may not enhance employees’ resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Objective: With a descriptive epidemiological framing, we assessed whether recent historical patterns of regional influenza burden are reflected in the observed heterogeneity in COVID-19 cases across regions of the world. Methods: Weekly surveillance data reported by the World Health Organization from January 2017 to December 2019 for influenza and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020, for COVID-19 were used to assess seasonal and temporal trends for influenza and COVID-19 cases across the seven World Bank regions. Results: In regions with more pronounced influenza seasonality, COVID-19 epidemics have largely followed trends similar to those seen for influenza from 2017 to 2019. COVID-19 epidemics in countries across Europe, Central Asia, and North America have been marked by a first peak during the spring, followed by significant reductions in COVID-19 cases in the summer months and a second wave in the fall. In Latin America and the Caribbean, COVID-19 epidemics in several countries peaked in the summer, corresponding to months with the highest influenza activity in the region. Countries from regions with less pronounced influenza activity, including South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, showed more heterogeneity in COVID-19 epidemics seen to date. However, similarities in COVID-19 and influenza trends were evident within select countries irrespective of region. Conclusions: Ecological consistency in COVID-19 trends seen to date with influenza trends suggests the potential for shared individual, structural, and environmental determinants of transmission. Using a descriptive epidemiological framework to assess shared regional trends for rapidly emerging respiratory pathogens with better studied respiratory infections may provide further insights into the differential impacts of nonpharmacologic interventions and intersections with environmental conditions. Ultimately, forecasting trends and informing interventions for novel respiratory pathogens like COVID-19 should leverage epidemiologic patterns in the relative burden of past respiratory pathogens as prior information. ©Stefan David Baral, Katherine Blair Rucinski, Jean Olivier Twahirwa Rwema, Amrita Rao, Neia Prata Menezes, Daouda Diouf, Adeeba Kamarulzaman, Nancy Phaswana-Mafuya, Sharmistha Mishra.","Assessment; Burden; COVID-19; Descriptive epidemiology; Epidemiology; Flu; Global health; Influenza; Pattern; Public health; Relationship; SARS-CoV-2; Transmission; Virus","cost of illness; epidemiology; global health; human; influenza; Cost of Illness; COVID-19; Epidemiologic Studies; Global Health; Humans; Influenza, Human"

In this report, a short analysis focusing on Aus-tralia, Italy, and the United Kingdom is conducted. The analysis includes confirmed and recovered cases and deaths, the growth rate in Australia compared with that in Italy and the United Kingdom, and the trend of the disease in different Australian regions. Mathematical approaches based on sus-ceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR) cases and susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, and recovered (SEIQR) cases models are proposed to predict epidemiology in the above-mentioned countries. Since the performance of the classic forms of SIR and SEIQR depends on parameter set-tings, some optimization algorithms, namely Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS), conju-gate gradients (CG), limited memory bound constrained BFGS ( L-BFGS-B), and Nelder–Mead, are proposed to optimize the parameters and the predictive capabilities of the SIR and SEIQR models. The results of the optimized SIR and SEIQR models were compared with those of two well-known machine learning algorithms, i.e., the Prophet algorithm and logistic function. The results demon-strate the different behaviors of these algorithms in different countries as well as the better performance of the improved SIR and SEIQR models. Moreover, the Prophet algorithm was found to provide better prediction performance than the logistic function, as well as better prediction performance for Italy and UK cases than for Australian cases. Therefore, it seems that the Prophet algorithm is suitable for data with an increasing trend in the context of a pandemic. Optimization of SIR and SEIQR model parameters yielded a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of the models. Despite the availability of several algorithms for trend predictions in this pandemic, there is no single algorithm that would be optimal for all cases. © 2021 by the authors.

E-government and social media have been used widely during this unprecedented time to spread awareness and educate the public on preventive measures. However, the extent to which the 2 digital platforms bring to improve public health awareness and prevention during a health crisis is unknown. In this study, we examined the influence of e-government and social media on the public's attitude to adopt protective behavior. For this purpose, a Web survey was conducted among 404 Malaysian residents during the Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) period in the country. Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS software. Social media was chosen by most of the respondents (n = 331 or 81.9%) as the source to get information related to COVID-19. Multiple regression analysis suggests the roles of e-government and social media to be significantly related to people's attitudes to engage in protective behavior. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 outbreak, public health decision makers may use e-government and social media platforms as effective tools to improve public engagement on protective behavior. This, in turn, will help the country to contain the transmission of the virus. © Copyright © 2021 Mat Dawi, Namazi, Hwang, Ismail, Maresova and Krejcar.","attitude; COVID-19; e-government; Malaysia; protective behavior; social media","adolescent; adult; attitude; awareness; female; government; human; information dissemination; Malaysia; male; prevention and control; public health; questionnaire; social media; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Attitude; Awareness; COVID-19; Female; Government; Humans; Information Dissemination; Malaysia; Male; Public Health; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"

Despite the existence of effective vaccine and screening tools, efforts to reduce the burden of cervical cancer must be considered in the context of the social structures within the health systems of LMICs. Compounding this existing challenge is the global COVID-19 pandemic, declared in March 2020. While it is too soon to tell how health systems priorities will change as a result of COVID-19 and its impact on the cervical cancer elimination agenda, there are opportunities to strengthen cervical screening by leveraging on several trends. Many LMICs maximized the strengths of their long established community-based primary care and public health systems with expansion of surveillance systems which incorporated mobile technologies. LMICs can harness the momentum of the measures taken against COVID-19 to consolidate the efforts against cervical cancer. Self-sampling, molecular human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and digital health will shift health systems towards stronger public health and primary care networks and away from expensive hospital-based care investments. While COVID-19 will change health systems priorities in LMICs in ways that may de-prioritize cervical cancer screening, there are significant opportunities for integration into longer-term trends towards universal health coverage, self-care and digital health. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"Article; cancer screening; clinical effectiveness; clinical examination; colposcopy; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; cytology; disease elimination; DNA screening; ethnicity; health care access; health care policy; health promotion; human; investment; low income country; middle income country; mobile application; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; primary medical care; priority journal; privacy; self care; socioeconomics; universal health care; uterine cervix cancer; vagina smear; validation process; developing country; early cancer diagnosis; epidemiology; female; health care planning; papillomavirus infection; prevention and control; uterine cervix tumor; COVID-19; Developing Countries; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Health Priorities; Humans; Papillomavirus Infections; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"
"Alignment of islamic banking sustainability indicators with sustainable development goals: Policy recommendations for addressing the covid-19 pandemic",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102512214&doi=10.3390%2fsu13052607&partnerID=40&md5=493f5c610e88c6c19d2610596563dd23","This study aims to establish the link of key Islamic banking sustainability indicators with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) as a policy recommendation for sustainable development and to mitigate the distressing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the triple bottom line (people, planet, and profit). To identify the key Islamic banking sustainability indicators, the authors selected the most cited sustainability measurement indexes in Islamic banking. Initially, the indexes were divided into 10 broader themes, and then the key Islamic banking sustainability indicators were shortlisted from each theme based on their high-frequency distribution. The shortlisted sustainability indicators were then ratified to be in line with Islamic philosophy based on “Maqasid al-Shariah” (objectives of Shariah) and were subsequently grouped into the three dimensions of economic, environmental, and social sustainability based on the axial coding method. Finally, the categorized sustainability indicators were aligned with the relevant UN SDGs through the axial coding method for policy formulation, and respectively 12 propositions were developed for policy formulation. This study labeled the methodological process of this study as the ECA method (exploration, categorization, alignment). The new ECA method offers a reverse extension in the “SDG compass” developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for aligning business policies with the UN SDGs. The process of aligning Islamic banking sustainability indicators with the UN SDGs will provide a roadmap to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of economic, environmental, and social issues. Due to the diversity of the UN SDG framework, it covers multiples aspects for sustainable development. Therefore, considering the UN SDGs in terms of various banking instruments will mitigate the multiple distressing impacts of COVID-19 on the triple bottom line (people, planet, and profit), it will also promote a sustainable development agenda. © 2021 by the authors.

Millions of people have been infected, and the livelihood of many has been jeopardized due to the pandemic. Pharmaceutical companies are racing against time to develop an effective vaccine to protect against COVID-19. Researchers have developed various types of candidate vaccines with the release of the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in January. These include inactivated viral vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, mRNA vaccines, and recombinant viral vector vaccines. To date, several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use and they have been administered in countries across the globe. Meanwhile, there are also vaccine candidates in Phase III clinical trials awaiting results and approval from authorities. These candidates have shown positive results in the previous stages of the trials, whereby they could induce an immune response with minimal side effects in the participants.

Effective vaccines are urgently needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. No vaccines have yet been approved for licensure by regulatory agencies. Even though host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections are beginning to be unravelled, effective clearance of virus will depend on both humoral and cellular immunity. Additionally, the presence of Spike (S)-glycoprotein reactive CD4+ T-cells in the majority of convalescent patients is consistent with its significant role in stimulating B and CD8+ T-cells. The search for immunodominant epitopes relies on experimental evaluation of peptides representing the epitopes from overlapping peptide libraries which can be costly and labor-intensive. Recent advancements in B- and T-cell epitope predictions by bioinformatic analysis have led to epitope identifications. Assessing which peptide epitope can induce potent neutralizing antibodies and robust T-cell responses is a prerequisite for the selection of effective epitopes to be incorporated in peptide-based vaccines. This review discusses the roles of B- and T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 infections and experimental validations for the selection of B-, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes which could lead to the construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine. Peptide-based vaccines are known for their low immunogenicity which could be overcome by incorporating immunostimulatory adjuvants and nanoparticles such as Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA) or chitosan. © 2020 Chang Gung University","B-cell;

Universities are among the organizations that have asked students, tutors, and lecturers to use a number of different online communication platforms to ensure the education process remains uninterrupted. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has generated considerable challenges for the global higher education community while using such emerging technologies. This research has two main goals. First, this paper will begin by investigating whether the online learning platforms used by university students during the COVID-19 period have presented any challenges to their learning. Second, the paper will then go on to address proposed solutions by developing a conceptual model to reduce the impact of such challenges. This research uses an exploratory qualitative research approach, supported by literature content analysis techniques. The data set for this study was collected during the first peak of the pandemic period in Malaysia, between the 16th of May 2020 and the 5th of June 2020. We used SPSS to conduct a descriptive analysis and NVivo12 to analyse data collected from 486 students from different universities in Malaysia. These students disclosed various obstacles they en-countered when they used IT platform applications for online learning. These obstacles include (a) work and information overload received from instructors, (b) inadaptability and unfamiliarity of the new online learning environment, and (c) personal health challenges related to stress and anxi-ety. Based on previous relevant research, this study introduced a set of motivational factors and developed a conceptual motivational model for sustainable and healthy online learning. © 2021 by the authors.

It does so by extending the theory of reasoned action (TRA) by including the social servicescape of the cruise ship dining experiencescape (stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) para-digm) and perceived health risk from COVID-19 (the prospect theory). The developed theoretical framework based on this tripartite approach has predictive power for intentions. Its effectiveness and comprehensiveness are also demonstrated. Despite the positive effect of the social servicescape on attitude and emotions and the positive attitude of female cruise travelers, the negative effect of the perceived health risk from COVID-19 appears to be the dominant factor that ultimately discour-ages the behavioral intentions of female cruise passengers towards dining on a cruise ship in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The present research provides a crucial guiding framework that helps cruise academics and operators to maximize existing and potential passengers’ favorable decisions and behaviors for cruise ship dining. © 2021 by the authors.

An online survey questionnaire was completed by 611 adults residing in Malaysia. The four domains, derived from factor analysis, affirmed the supportive perception among the public (score range = 4.42 to 4.64/5.0). However, among the gaps identified were the perception toward hand sanitizing and susceptibility of older adults to COVID-19. Public knowledge on symptoms of COVID-19 was limited (e.g., 41.4% to 53.4% incorrect responses to anosmia, diarrhea, confusion). Multivariate analysis of variance found that males and participants with less education had significantly lower supportive perceptions (p < 0.05).

This study aimed to compare anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown among adults from 11 countries and to examine their associations with country-level COVID-19 factors and personal COVID-19 exposure. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among adults (≥18 years) in 11 countries (Brazil, Bulgaria, China, India, Ireland, North Macedonia, Malaysia, Singapore, Spain, Turkey, United States). Mental health (anxiety, depression, resilient coping, hope) and other study data were collected between June–August 2020. Of the 13,263 participants, 62.8% were female and 51.7% were 18–34 years old. Participants living in Brazil had the highest anxiety and depression symptoms while participants living in Singapore had the lowest. Greater personal COVID-19 exposure was associated with increased anxiety and depression symptoms, but country-level COVID-19 factors were not. Higher levels of hope were associated with reduced anxiety and depression; higher levels of resilient coping were associated with reduced anxiety but not depression. Substantial variations exist in anxiety and depression symptoms across countries during the COVID-19 lockdown, with personal COVID-19 exposure being a significant risk factor. Strategies that mitigate COVID-19 exposure and enhance hope and resilience may reduce anxiety and depression during global emergencies. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: Participants were consented to answer a physician-administered questionnaire following Ramadan 2020. Impact of COVID-19 on the decision of fasting, intentions to fast and duration of Ramadan and Shawal fasting, hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia events were assessed. Specific analysis comparing age categories of <65 years and ≥65 years were performed. Results: Among the 5865 participants, 22.5% were ≥65 years old. Concern for COVID-19 affected fasting decision for 7.6% (≥65 years) vs 5.4% (<65 years). More participants ≥65 years old did not fast (28.8% vs 12.7%, <65 years). Of the 83.6%, participants fulfilling Ramadan-fasting, 94.8% fasted ≥15 days and 12.6% had to break fast due to diabetes-related illness. The average number of days fasting within and post-Ramadan were 27 and 6 days respectively, regardless of age. Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia occurred in 15.7% and 16.3% of participants respectively, with 6.5% and 7.4% requiring hospital care respectively. SMBG was performed in 73.8% of participants and 43.5% received Ramadan-focused education. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, universally high rates of Ramadan-fasting were observed regardless of fasting risk level. Glycemic complications occurred frequently with older adults requiring higher rates of acute hospital care. Risk stratification is essential followed by pre-Ramadan interventions, Ramadan-focused diabetes education and self-monitoring to reduce and prevent complications, with particular emphasis in older adults. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,"aged; Article; blood glucose monitoring; clinical decision making; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; education; female; geriatrics; hospital care; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physician; questionnaire; Ramadan fasting; self monitoring; adult; age; aging; attitude to health; blood; cross-sectional study; diet restriction; glucose blood level; Islam; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pandemic; physiology; very elderly; antidiabetic agent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Blood Glucose; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fasting; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Islam; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires"

In this study, we used molecular docking strategies to analyze 2.5-diaminobenzophenone compounds against Malaria and to compare results with the Nelfinavir as a FDA-approved HIV-1 protease inhibitor recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. These efforts identified the potential compounds against SAR-COV-2 Mpro with the docking scores ranges from −6.1 to −7.75 kcal/mol, which exhibited better interactions than the Nelfinavir. Among thirty-six studied, compounds 20c, 24c, 30c, 34c, 35c and 36c showed the highest affinity and involved in forming hydrophobic interactions with Glu166, Thr24, Thr25, and Thr26 residues and forming H-bonding interactions with Gln189, Cys145, and His41residues. Pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity (ADMET) were also determined for identified compounds. This study result in the identification of two compounds 35 and 36 having high binding affinity, good pharmacokinetics properties and lowest toxicity. The structural stability and dynamics of lead compounds within the active site of 3CLpro was also examined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Essential dynamics demonstrated that the two complexes remain stable during the entire duration of simulation. We have shown that these two lead molecules would have the potential to act as promising drug-candidates and would be of interest as starting point for designing compounds against the SARS-CoV-2. © 2021","Benzophenone; Inhibitor; Molecular Docking; Nelfinavir; SARS-CoV-2",

It has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). This shows that it has spread worldwide, transcending every border, and then finally penetrating every corner of the world. Despite its small size (measured in nanometer), its influence is great enough in triggering stress. As various countries declare a state of Emergency, restricted movement order and lockdown, varying reactions like sorrow, anxiety, misperception and fear have been ignited in the society. All of these have cumulatively caused stress among them. This current review paper summarizes and discusses the published literature addressing mental health concerns linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies show that excessive stress causes the failure in the individual’s mental and physical systems. The issue here is how the situation at the workplace, post-COVID-19 is different from the previous situation. Thus, the psychological preparation of every member in the organization is crucial to face the challenges coming their way. The available literature showed consensus that the COVID-19 pandemic not only affects physical health, but also stress and well-being.

Previous studies indicated that mattering was a robust predictor of life satisfaction; however, the nature of the quarantine might have affected the perception of social inclusion among individuals with certain levels of extraversions. Therefore, we hypothesized a moderated mediation model; mattering will interact with trait extraversion in predicting life satisfaction, and the prediction is mediated by perceived inclusion. Three hundred and ninety participants were voluntarily recruited to respond to scales such as Life Satisfaction Inventory, State Self-Esteem Scale, General Mattering Scale and the extraversion facet in Big Five Inventory. The scales, demography questions, and informed consent were accessible by online link given to the participants through social media. The analysis was conducted by using PROCESS Macro model eight for statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) applying the Bootstrap analysis with 5000 samples and 95% confidence interval. The result suggested that the hypothesis was confirmed; perceived inclusion levels significantly mediated the association between mattering and life satisfaction among individuals with low and moderate levels of extraversion. However, full mediation only applied among the individuals with moderate extraversion, because among those with low extraversion, mattering was still a significant predictor of life satisfaction. © 2021, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan - Faculty of Publich Health.

The infectious spread grew in leaps and bounds and forced the policymakers and governments to move towards lockdown. The lockdown further compelled people to stay under house arrest, which further resulted in an outbreak of emotions on social media platforms. Perceiving people's emotional state during these times becomes critically and strategically important for the government and the policymakers. In this regard, a novel emotion care scheme has been proposed in this paper to analyze multimodal textual data contained in real-time tweets related to COVID-19. Moreover, this paper studies 8-scale emotions (Anger, Anticipation, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, and Trust) over multiple categories such as nature, lockdown, health, education, market, and politics. This is the first of its kind linguistic analysis on multiple modes pertaining to the pandemic to the best of our understanding. Taking India as a case study, we inferred from this textual analysis that ‘joy’ has been lesser towards everything (~9-15%) but nature (~17%) due to the apparent fact of lessened pollution. The education system entailed more trust (~29%) due to teachers' fraternity's consistent efforts. The health sector witnessed sadness (~16%) and fear (~18%) as the dominant emotions among the masses as human lives were at stake.

There are no specific antiviral drugs available to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides the rapid dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, several variants have been identified with a potential epidemiologic and pathogenic variation. This fact has forced antiviral drug development strategies to stay innovative, including new drug discovery protocols, combining drugs, and establishing new drug classes. Thus, developing novel screening methods and direct-targeting viral enzymes could be an attractive strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we designed, optimized, and validated a cell-based assay protocol for high-throughput screening (HTS) antiviral drug inhibitors against main viral protease (3CLpro). We applied the split-GFP complementation to develop GFP-split-3CLpro HTS system. The system consists of GFP-based reporters that become fluorescent upon cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro. We generated a stable GFP-split-3CLpro HTS system valid to screen large drug libraries for inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2 main protease in the bio-safety level 2 laboratory, providing real-time antiviral activity of the tested compounds.

Conventional teaching methods are now being replaced by non-conventional modes of teaching, which include online teaching and assessment using various platforms such as Zoom, WebEx and others. In embarking on online methods of teaching, social work educators will have to undergo many changes. It is particularly so as social work has a practice component that involves field training, which will be a different challenge to educators and students in this new and unexpected environment.

Although disinfectants may not be applied directly to the human body, it remains at high risk of exposure including close skin contact on disinfected surfaces or during handling. This dermal contact, on a regular basis, can induce hazardous skin reactions like irritation, inflammation, and burning in severe conditions. Disinfectants are germicide chemicals that can penetrate the skin and create skin reactions that are usually regarded as irritant and allergic contact dermatitis. More importantly, disinfectants can react with skin components (proteins and lipids) to facilitate their skin penetration and disrupt the skin barrier function. Whereas the antimicrobial actions of disinfectants are well understood, much less is known regarding their dermatologic reactions, including but not limited to irritation and hypersensitivity. We reviewed the skin reactions created by those disinfectants against SARS-CoV-2 approved by the European Chemical Agency and the US Environmental Protection Agency. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"disinfectant agent; human; prevention and control; skin allergy; COVID-19; Dermatitis, Allergic Contact; Disinfectants; Humans"

Whilst this pandemic has presented the healthcare system with unprecedented challenges, it has rapidly promoted the adoption of telemedicine to deliver healthcare at a distance. Telemedicine is the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for collecting, organizing, storing, retrieving, and exchanging medical information. But it is faced with the limitations of conventional IP-based protocols which makes it challenging to provide Quality of Service (QoS) for telemedicine due to issues arising from network congestion. Likewise, medical professionals adopting telemedicine are affected with low QoS during health consultations with outpatients due to increased internet usage. Therefore, this study proposes a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based telemedicine architecture to provide QoS during telemedicine health consultations. This study utilizes secondary data from existing research works in the literature to provide a roadmap for the application of SDN to improve QoS in telemedicine during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study present a practical approach for applying SDN in telemedicine to provide appropriate bandwidth and facilitate real time transmission of medical data. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Health consultation; Medical systems; Pandemic; Software-defined networking; Telemedicine","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; health care quality; human; Internet; outpatient; secondary analysis; software defined networking; teleconsultation"

Allergists and other healthcare providers (HCPs) in the field of allergies and associated airway diseases are on the front line, taking care of patients potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2. Hence, strategies and practices to minimize risks of infection for both HCPs and treated patients have to be developed and followed by allergy clinics. Method: The scientific information on COVID-19 was analysed by a literature search in MEDLINE, PubMed, the National and International Guidelines from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the Cochrane Library, and the internet. Results: Based on the diagnostic and treatment standards developed by EAACI, on international information regarding COVID-19, on guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international organizations, and on previous experience, a panel of experts including clinicians, psychologists, IT experts, and basic scientists along with EAACI and the “Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA)” initiative have developed recommendations for the optimal management of allergy clinics during the current COVID-19 pandemic. These recommendations are grouped into nine sections on different relevant aspects for the care of patients with allergies. Conclusions: This international Position Paper provides recommendations on operational plans and procedures to maintain high standards in the daily clinical care of allergic patients while ensuring the necessary safety measures in the current COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

The accident involves the most between the motorcyclist and other vehicles such as a passenger car which is 17 times safer than the motorcyclist. Current research reveals that the three major forms of incidents in Malaysia are single-motorcycle incidents, passenger car crashes and cars–motorcycles crash. In general, the lack of accuracy of road geometric design, traffic volumes and overlapping movements of vehicles was the main cause of road accidents in Malaysia, which caused drivers to make mistakes and errors due to road geometric characteristics and traffic environments. However, during our recent COVID-19 pandemic, the traffic volumes are relatively low in the whole country as the government announces the movement control order in March 2020. The country was almost completely lockdown (people and vehicles' movements were controlled). In contrast with the reduction of the traffic volumes, the number of crashes shows relatively high numbers. This phenomenon can be derived so that other factors cause vehicle crashes and fatalities should be considered. Several factors related to road geometric such as lane width, shoulder width, access point, curve length and tangent length are considered in developing profiles of operating speed for motorcycles and cars formed of tangents and curves. The analysis of the geometric factors and traffic environments took place at federal road F0050 from 21 to 25 km in Johor, Malaysia. This study was carried out using GPS (DG-200) where the data (vehicles tracked movements) on the continuous speed profiles used a current method of analysis to determine the profiles of road design consistency for motorcycles and cars. The profiles are used to measure the importance index of the integrated design consistency model of the road. The model depends on parameters such as the confine region of speed profiles, average speed, and velocity deviation standard of the profiles. Therefore, a special software of ACAD was used to build the profile of the consistency model. The design accuracy of the speed profile in traffic and safety assessments are affected by the integrated-consistency model. The highest number of accidents has been identified at 24 km at F0050 based on the area design consistency where poor design is the integrated quality consistency model for car and motorcycle. The study shows that crashes and fatalities are not fully affected by traffic volumes but road design performances and driving behaviors. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cars–motorcycles; Geometric features; Linear profiles; Movement control order; Road accidents",

This paper aims to examine how the outbreak may alter Chinese tourists’ lifestyle choices, travel behaviour and tourism preferences in the short and long term. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on the synthesis of news broadcasted by several media outlets to be supported by an overview of the related literature on tourism marketing, tourism management and tourist behaviour. The authors’ experiences investigating trends in tourism and hospitality at the local and international level have also contributed to the study. Findings: This paper predicts that COVID-19 will likely affect Chinese travellers’ consumption patterns, such as the growing popularity of free and independent travel, luxury trips and health and wellness tourism. New forms of tourism including slow tourism and smart tourism may also drive future tourism activities. Such changes are likely to force businesses to reconsider their service designs and distribution channels. Research limitations/implications: While Chinese and other potential visitors rethink how they travel, professionals, too, should reflect upon how to bring positive or negative changes to the tourism industry following this pandemic. Subsequent research should also consider how to mitigate the effects of similar public health crises in the future. Practical implications: Recommendations for industry practitioners and policymakers focus on tailoring travel arrangements to tourists’ backgrounds. The suggestions may help to alleviate outbreak-related stress, offer travellers newly enriching experiences and partially mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the tourism and hospitality industry. These recommendations can also apply more broadly to global tourist markets. Social implications: The COVID-19 outbreak has already brought significant impacts to nearly every society and industry. Tourism scholars and practitioners should carefully consider this tragedy and how it may inform industry and social practices. This and other public health crises represent sterling opportunities to view the industry holistically in terms of its effects on the environment, climate and travellers themselves. Originality/value: This paper presumably represents a frontier study, critically examining the possible impacts of COVID-19 on Chinese travellers’ consumption patterns and how the tourism and hospitality industry may respond to such changes in the future. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; Collectivist orientation; COVID-19; Lifestyle; Post-disaster; Travel behaviour",

However, its effect on individual-organizational relations and, consequently, on organizational performance remains understudied. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the spillover effect of financial insecurity on the burnout–disengagement relationship during the pandemic. The authors investigate in particular whether the spillover effect influences the performance of moonlighting employees and also explore the mediating effect of disengagement on the relationship between financial insecurity and burnout interaction effect and the performance (i.e., mediated-moderation). This study collected responses from 162 public and private sector employees who are engaged in moonlighting activities in Malaysia. The results from the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) revealed greater levels of financial insecurity and burnout associated with greater levels of work disengagement. The analysis of the interaction-moderation effect showed that when financial insecurity rises, the burnout effect on work disengagement increases among moonlighters. Using the PROCESS macro model, the results displayed burnout as a predictor of extra-role performance via a moderated (financial insecurity) mediation (work disengagement) relationship. Going forward, this study not only opens new avenues for research into the financial consequences of COVID-19 but also calls on managers to take proactive steps to mitigate the negative effect of the pandemic on the performance of moonlighting employees to keep them in the profession. © Copyright © 2021 Rasdi, Zaremohzzabieh and Ahrari.","burnout; COVID-19; disengagement; employees’ performance; financial insecurity; moonlight",

Symptoms of long-COVID include fatigue, dyspnea, gastrointestinal and cardiac problems, cognitive impairments, myalgia, and others. While the possible causes of long-COVID include long-term tissue damage, viral persistence, and chronic inflammation, the review proposes, perhaps for the first time, that persistent brainstem dysfunction may also be involved. This hypothesis can be split into two parts. The first is the brainstem tropism and damage in COVID-19. As the brainstem has a relatively high expression of ACE2 receptor compared with other brain regions, SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit tropism therein. Evidence also exists that neuropilin-1, a co-receptor of SARS-CoV-2, may be expressed in the brainstem. Indeed, autopsy studies have found SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins in the brainstem. The brainstem is also highly prone to damage from pathological immune or vascular activation, which has also been observed in autopsy of COVID-19 cases. The second part concerns functions of the brainstem that overlap with symptoms of long-COVID. The brainstem contains numerous distinct nuclei and subparts that regulate the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and neurological processes, which can be linked to long-COVID. As neurons do not readily regenerate, brainstem dysfunction may be long-lasting and, thus, is long-COVID. Indeed, brainstem dysfunction has been implicated in other similar disorders, such as chronic pain and migraine and myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","brain autopsy; brainstem; coronavirus; Long-COVID; nervous system; tropism","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus protein; neuropilin 1; virus RNA; neuropilin 1; virus RNA; autopsy; brain region; brain stem; chronic fatigue syndrome; chronic inflammation; chronic pain; cognitive defect; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; dyspnea; fatigue; gastrointestinal symptom; heart disease; human; medulla oblongata; migraine; myalgia; neurological complication; nonhuman; postinfectious encephalopathy; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral tropism; virus pathogenesis; brain disease; brain stem; complication; genetics; inflammation; isolation and purification; metabolism; pathogenicity; pathophysiology; thrombosis; vascularization; virology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Brain Diseases; Brain Stem; COVID-19; Humans; Inflammation; Neuropilin-1; Receptors, Coronavirus; RNA, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Thrombosis; Viral Tropism"

All data was analyzed using SPSS version 25 and AMOS version 26 using T-test, ANOVA, logistic regression analyses, and path analysis method. Findings: Findings indicated that 22, 34.3, and 37.3% of the university students scored moderate to extremely severe levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, respectively. Half scored rather happy or very happy (50%) for happiness levels. Meanwhile, 50.4 and 39.4% scored high to very high levels of work-to-family and family-to-work conflict. Significant differences in stress, anxiety, depression, happiness, work-family conflict, and family-work conflict were recorded across different demographic factors. Happiness was found to be a protective factor with a lesser likelihood of experiencing severe stress (OR = 0.240, 95% CI: 0.180, 0.321), anxiety (OR = 0.336, 95% CI: 0.273, 0.414), and depression (OR = 0.121, 95% CI: 0.088, 0.165) with higher happiness levels. Higher score of work-to-family conflict contributes to greater odds of having severe levels of anxiety (OR = 1.453, 95% CI: 1.161, 1.818). While greater likelihood of developing severe stress (OR = 1.468, 95% CI: 1.109, 1.943) and severe anxiety (OR = 1.317, 95% CI: 1.059, 1.638) under increasing score of family-to-work conflict. Besides, happiness is found to negatively linked with lower negative emotional symptoms, while work-family conflict and family-work conflict are positively linked with higher negative emotional symptoms. Conclusion: Lockdown implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have a significant impact on university students' negative emotional symptoms, happiness, and work-life balance. Happiness was found to be a protective factor while the state of work-life balance is a risk factor that can predict students' negative emotional symptoms. © Copyright © 2021 Wan Mohd Yunus, Badri, Panatik and Mukhtar.","anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; depression; happiness; lockdown; stress; students; work-life balance","adolescent; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; demography; depression; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; disease association; disease severity; emotional disorder; ethnicity; family conflict; female; happiness; human; lockdown; major clinical study; Malaysia; Malaysian; male; pandemic; personal experience; physiological stress; risk factor; university student; work-life balance"

Because of the time constraints associated with the development of vaccines and effective drugs, drug repurposing and other alternative treatment methods have been used to treat patients that have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have acquired COVID-19. Objective: The objective of this systematic scoping review is to provide an overview of the molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease. Method: The research articles or gray literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online, were identified from four databases and one search engine. The full content of a total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and information about six drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and chloroquine) and four Traditional Chinese Medicines (Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye, TCM combination of Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San and Da Yuan Yin, Xue Bi Jing Injection, and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang) was extracted. Results: All of the repurposed drugs and complementary medicine that have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 depend on the ability of the drug to inhibit the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to enzyme active sites, viral chain termination, or triggering of the molecular pathway, whereas Traditional Chinese Medicine plays a pivotal role in triggering the inflammation pathway, such as the neuraminidase blocker, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. © Copyright © 2021 Lem, Opook, Lee, Chee, Lawson and Chin.","alternative medicine; COVID-19; molecular mechanism; repurposed drugs; SARS-CoV-2","Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San; Chinese medicinal formula; chloroquine; Da Yuan Yin; favipiravir; lopinavir; oseltamivir; Qing Fei Pai Du Tang; remdesivir; ritonavir; shuang huang lian; unclassified drug; xuebijing; alternative medicine; Chinese medicine; coronavirus disease 2019; drug mechanism; drug repositioning; enzyme active site; human; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review"

It was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization and activated response teams at almost all Malaysian healthcare facilities. Upon activation of the National Crisis Preparedness and Response Center in January 2020, the National Institutes of Health Malaysia established a COVID-19 operation room at the facility level to address the rise in COVID-19 infection cases each day. The National Institutes of Health COVID-19 operation room committee formed a workforce mobilization team for an effective and efficient mobilization system to fulfill requests received for human resource aid within the Ministry of Health Malaysia facilities. Selected personnel would be screened for health and availability before mobilization letters and logistics arrangements if necessary. The workforce from the National Institutes of Health, consisting of various job positions, were mobilized every week, with each deployment cycle lasting 2 weeks. A total of 128 personnel from the six institutes under the National Institutes of Health were mobilized: tasks included fever screening, active case detection, health management at quarantine centers, and management of dead bodies. A well-organized data management system with a centralized online system integration could allow more rapid deployment and answer some of the key questions in managing a similar pandemic in the future.

METHODS We randomly assigned inpatients with Covid-19 equally between one of the trial drug regimens that was locally available and open control (up to five options, four active and the local standard of care). The intention-to-treat primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality in the four pairwise comparisons of each trial drug and its control (drug available but patient assigned to the same care without that drug). Rate ratios for death were calculated with stratification according to age and status regarding mechanical ventilation at trial entry. RESULTS At 405 hospitals in 30 countries, 11,330 adults underwent randomization; 2750 were assigned to receive remdesivir, 954 to hydroxychloroquine, 1411 to lopinavir (without interferon), 2063 to interferon (including 651 to interferon plus lopinavir), and 4088 to no trial drug. Adherence was 94 to 96% midway through treatment, with 2 to 6% crossover. In total, 1253 deaths were reported (median day of death, day 8; interquartile range, 4 to 14). The Kaplan–Meier 28-day mortality was 11.8% (39.0% if the patient was already receiving ventilation at randomization and 9.5% otherwise). Death occurred in 301 of 2743 patients receiving remdesivir and in 303 of 2708 receiving its control (rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.11; P=0.50), in 104 of 947 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 84 of 906 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.59; P=0.23), in 148 of 1399 patients receiving lopinavir and in 146 of 1372 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.25; P=0.97), and in 243 of 2050 patients receiving interferon and in 216 of 2050 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.39; P=0.11). No drug definitely reduced mortality, overall or in any subgroup, or reduced initiation of ventilation or hospitalization duration. CONCLUSIONS These remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay.

Now known to the world as COVID-19, the devastating disease of what has become a pandemic started its spread from Wuhan, China and swiftly engulfed the whole world with almost 11 million cases, in a span of around six months. It has not only increased the global burden of disease but has heavily dented many social institutions, including education. Methods: This study investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent measures of lockdown, quarantine, and social distancing have affected students. We look specifically into the effects on individuals' mental health, that is, the stress and anxiety levels of college and university students using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Results: Among 494 respondents, 61% were females, and the majority (77.3%) of the students were in the age group of 19-25 years. Among the respondents, 125 (25.3%), 45 (9.1%) and 34 (6.9%) experienced minimal to moderate, severe, and most extreme levels of anxiety, respectively. The variables of gender, age and year of study were significant at the 0.25 level by univariate analyses. Nevertheless, the ordinal regression indicates that only gender was significant. The odds of a female student being more anxious are higher compared to a male student (OR = 1.779, 95% CI [1.202-2.634], P = 0.004). The most prominent stressors attained from the qualitative feedback from the Pakistani students are associated with online teaching, concerns about their academic performance and completion of the current semester, uncertainty related to exam dates, and the status of the following semester. Conclusions: This study will add to the existing body of literature on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and psychological health of students. The study outcomes will provide basic data for further applied and action research and a framework for universities and policy makers in Pakistan and the neighboring countries in the region with the same cultural contexts. Thus, relevant health interventions can be designed for better mental health and educational attainments of students from higher educational institutions. This pathological pandemic may well lead to another pandemic of mental and behavioral illness. All stakeholders should join force regardless of pre-existing differences and inequalities to ensure the well-being of future generations, specifically students from higher educational institutions. The long-lasting impacts and the aftermath of this pandemic will unquestionably need further and future investigations.

By analysing the transmission dynamics during the first wave of COVID-19 in the country, the effectiveness of the various levels of control actions taken to flatten the curve can be better quantified and understood. This in turn can help the relevant authorities to better plan for and control the subsequent waves of the pandemic. To achieve this, a deterministic population model for the pandemic is firstly developed to take into consideration the time-dependent characteristics of the model parameters, especially on the ever-evolving value of the reproduction number, which is one of the critical measures used to describe the transmission dynamics of this pandemic. The reproduction number alongside other key parameters of the model can then be estimated by fitting the model to real-world data using numerical optimisation techniques or by inducing ad-hoc control actions as recorded in the news platforms. In this article, the model is verified using a case study based on the data from the first wave of COVID-19 in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The model is fitted to provide estimates for two settings in simulations; time-invariant and time-varying (with bounded constraints) parameters. Finally, some forecasts are made using four scenarios with time-dependent control measures so as to determine which would reflect on the actual situations better.

Teachers and students are now forced to teach and study online for an unidentified period, which severely hampers the learning capacity as well the student’s intention toward entrepreneurship. This study compared the impact of traditional teaching and teaching through online management simulation games on student learning performance and further leads to entrepreneurial intention. To further understand the desirability of business simulation games, we used the technology acceptance model (TAM) and extended it by employing knowledge sharing, knowledge application, learnability, perceived pleasure, and self-efficacy as exogenous variables. For this purpose, time-lagged data were collected from 277 students enrolled in entrepreneurship courses in public sector universities. To deal with homogeneity and generalizability issues, students from different collaborative universities were asked to participate in the study. Structural equation modeling was employed for analysis, where the results depict that the students learning performance was enhanced after using simulation games compared to regular theoretical online lectures, which further encouraged them to be entrepreneurs. We also concluded that simulation games are novel and effective online teaching methodology for students during a time of crisis.

Through the diagnostic social–ecological system (SES) framework, this review paper aimed to investigate what and how the multifaceted social, physical, and governance factors affected the success level of seven selected Asia-Pacific countries (namely, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and New Zealand) in combatting COVID-19. Drawing on statistical data from the Our World In Data website, we measured the COVID-19 severity or abatement success level of the countries on the basis of cumulative positive cases, average daily cases, and mortality rates for the period of 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2020. A qualitative content analysis using three codes, i.e., present (P), partially present (PP), and absent (A) for each SES attribute, as well as score calculation and rank ordering for government response effectiveness and the abatement success level across the countries, was undertaken. Not only did the standard coding process ensure data comparability but the data were deemed substantially reliable with Cohen’s kappa of 0.76. Among 13 attributes of the SES factors, high facility adequacy, comprehensive COVID-19 testing policies, strict lockdown measures, impo-sition of penalty, and the high trust level towards the government seemed to be significant in de-termining the COVID-19 severity in a country. The results show that Vietnam (ranked first) and New Zealand (ranked second), with a high presence of attributes/design principles contributing to high-level government stringency and health and containment indices, successfully controlled the virus, while Indonesia (ranked seventh) and Japan (ranked sixth), associated with the low presence of design principles, were deemed least successful. Two lessons can be drawn: (i) having high number of P for SES attributes does not always mean a panacea for the pandemic; however, it would be detrimental to a country if it lacked them severely, and (ii) some attributes (mostly from the governance factor) may carry higher weightage towards explaining the success level. This comparative study providing an overview of critical SES attributes in relation to COVID-19 offers novel policy insights, thus helping policymakers devise more strategic, coordinated measures, particularly for effective country preparedness and response in addressing the current and the future health crisis. © 2021 by the authors.

Specifically, consumers might exhibit higher versus lower preferences for typical (vs. atypical) products. Drawing upon the literature on consumption-based affect regulation and consumers’ mindset, this research seeks to reconcile these seemingly conflicting findings by establishing the moderating role of consumers’ mindset. In three experimental studies, we show that among consumers with a fixed (vs. growth) mindset, perceived threat of COVID-19 would lead to higher (vs. lower) preferences for typical products.

The disease has had a huge influence worldwide, and the nation has been put in lockdown by this health crisis. The psychological health, physical health and economic condition of individuals are adversely impacted by quarantine and lockdown. As mobility is reduced, there will be a dramatic shift in the population's lifestyle, where the people's physical activity level will decrease. Low levels of physical exercise can lead to a large number of obesity cases. Therefore, steps for obesity prevention and management need to be taken. One approach is to administer nutrition with accuracy through precision nutrition. Therefore, this research aims to review articles on precision nutrition for the treatment and control of obesity towards a restricted movement order during the COVID-19 health crisis. The literature search was conducted from May 2020 until January 2021 using Scopus and Science Direct as the main databases. The articles included follow the inclusion criteria published in English language, including nutrition intervention for prevention and management of obesity, focus on health crisis, and no restriction of time and study design. Various studies show that precision nutrition has a potential benefit in preventing or controlling obesity prevalence due to restricted movement order or quarantine upon health crisis. © 2021 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

These services largely breakdowns due to restrictions on border movements, confined travel and transportation services, a decline in international tourists’ visitation, nationwide lock-downs, and maintaining social distancing in the population. Although these measures are highly needed to contain coronavirus, it decreases economic and financial activities in a country, which re-quires smart solutions to globally subsidize the services sector. The study used different COVID-19 measures, and its resulting impact on the services industry by using world aggregated data from 1975 through 2020. The study benefited from the Keynesian theory of aggregate demand that re-mains provided a solution to minimize economic shocks through stringent or liberalizing economic policies. The COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than the financial shocks of 2018 that affected almost all sectors of the globalized world, particularly the services sector, which has been severally affected by COVID-19; it is a high time to revisit economic policies to control pandemic recession. The study used quantiles regression and innovation accounting matrix to obtain ex-ante and ex-post analysis. The quantile regression estimates show that causes of death by communicable diseases, including COVID-19, mainly decline the share of services value added to the global GDP at different quantiles distribution. In contrast, word-of-mouth helps to prevent it from the transmission channel of coronavirus plague through information sharing among the general masses. The control of food prices and managing physical distancing reduces suspected coronavirus cases; however, it negatively affects the services sector’s value share. The smart lockdown and sound economic activities do not decrease coronavirus cases, while they support increasing the percentage of the services sector to the global GDP. The innovation accounting matrix suggested that smart lockdown, managing physical distancing, effective price control, and sound financial activities will help to reduce coronavirus cases that will further translate into increased services value-added for the next ten years. The social distancing will exert a more considerable variance error shock to the services industry, which indicates the viability of these measures to contained novel coronavirus over a time horizon. The study used the number of proxies to the COVID-19 measures on the service sector that can be continued with real-time variables to obtain more inferences. © 2021 by the authors.

This study compared the weekly dengue incidences during the period of lockdown to the previous years (2015 to 2019) and a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model that expected no movement restrictions. We found that the trend of dengue incidence during the first two weeks (stage 1) of lockdown decreased significantly with the incidences lower than the lower confidence level (LCL) of SARIMA. By comparing the magnitude of the gradient of decrease, the trend is 319% steeper than the trend observed in previous years and 650% steeper than the simulated model, indicating that the control of population movement did reduce dengue transmission. However, starting from stage 2 of lockdown, the dengue incidences demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by four weeks and grew with an exponential pattern. We revealed that Aedes albopictus is the predominant species and demonstrated a strong correlation with the locally reported dengue incidences, and therefore we proposed the possible diffusive effect of the vector that led to a higher acceleration of incidence rate. © 2021 Page Press Publications.

This study aims to examine the students' perception of online learning and the university's engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic. After one semester of fully online learning, a cross-sectional survey was conducted through online questionnaire among 716 design, architecture, and engineering students from Taylor's University to further examine the perception of online learning and its institution engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study shows that the pandemic has minor effect on their university plan where 84% are keen to re-enrol for the term and only 6% prefer to wait out the pandemic. Findings further show that the amount of time spent on completing assignments has increased compared to previous term (52%), yet students raised the concern about keeping up with the coursework in online learning environment (56%). Despite the majority of students associate their feelings of online learning with worried (49.6%), distracting (31.6%), and nervous (24.3%), results revealed 49% of students appreciate the university's effort in their academic initiative followed by 31% feeling thankful for the timely updates and hardship fund set up by the management and 20% are pleased with the university engagement related to well-being.

Smoking has been reported as one of the factors that increases severity and mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. However, the effect of smoking on such medical outcomes is still controversial. This study conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/ MA) on the association between smoking and negative outcomes among COVID-19 patients. METHODS Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Google Scholar, were systematically searched from the initiation of the database until 12 December 2020. All relevant studies about smoking and COVID-19 were screened using a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of eligible articles. Random meta-analyses were conducted to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs). Publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot, Begg's test and Egger's test. RESULTS A total of 1248 studies were retrieved and reviewed. A total of 40 studies were finally included for meta-analysis. Both current smoking and former smoking significantly increase the risk of disease severity (OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.16-2.15, p=0.004; and OR=2.48; 95% CI: 1.64- 3.77, p<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of heterogeneity. Similarly, current smoking and former smoking also significantly increase the risk of death (OR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.12-1.62, p=0.002; and OR=2.58; 95% CI: 2.15-3.09, p<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of heterogeneity. There was no evidence of publication bias, which was tested by the funnel plot, Begg's test and Egger's test. CONCLUSIONS Smoking, even current smoking or former smoking, significantly increases the risk of COVID-19 severity and death. Further causational studies on this association and ascertianing the underlying mechanisms of this relation is warranted. © 2021 Umnuaypornlert A. et al.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Death; Disease severity; Smoking",

Objective: This paper aimed to describe the development process of the COVID-19 Symptom Monitoring System (CoSMoS), which consists of a self-monitoring, algorithm-based Telegram bot and a teleconsultation system. We describe all the essential steps from the clinical perspective and our technical approach in designing, developing, and integrating the system into clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as lessons learned from this development process. Methods: CoSMoS was developed in three phases: (1) requirement formation to identify clinical problems and to draft the clinical algorithm, (2) development testing iteration using the agile software development method, and (3) integration into clinical practice to design an effective clinical workflow using repeated simulations and role-playing. Results: We completed the development of CoSMoS in 19 days. In Phase 1 (ie, requirement formation), we identified three main functions: a daily automated reminder system for patients to self-check their symptoms, a safe patient risk assessment to guide patients in clinical decision making, and an active telemonitoring system with real-time phone consultations. The system architecture of CoSMoS involved five components: Telegram instant messaging, a clinician dashboard, system administration (ie, back end), a database, and development and operations infrastructure. The integration of CoSMoS into clinical practice involved the consideration of COVID-19 infectivity and patient safety. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that developing a COVID-19 symptom monitoring system within a short time during a pandemic is feasible using the agile development method. Time factors and communication between the technical and clinical teams were the main challenges in the development process. The development process and lessons learned from this study can guide the future development of digital monitoring systems during the next pandemic, especially in developing countries. © Hooi Min Lim, Chin Hai Teo, Chirk Jenn Ng, Thiam Kian Chiew, Wei Leik Ng, Adina Abdullah, Haireen Abdul Hadi, Chee Sun Liew, Chee Seng Chan.","App; Coronavirus disease; COVID-19; Development; Digital health; EHealth; Health services research; Home monitoring; Infectious disease; MHealth; Symptom monitoring; System; Teleconsultation; Telesurveillance",

The formulation of functional materials requires synergistic understanding on the properties of materials and mechanisms of virus transmission and disease progression, including secondary bacterial infections that are prevalent in COVID-19 patients. A viable candidate in the struggle against the pandemic is antimicrobial polymer, due to their favorable properties of flexibility, lightweight, and ease of synthesis. Polymers are the base material for personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves, face mask, face shield, and coverall suit for frontliners. Conducting polymers (CPs) are polymers with electrical properties due to the addition of dopant in the polymer structure. The conductivity of polymers augments their antiviral and antibacterial properties. This review discusses the types of CPs and how their properties could be exploited to ward off bacterial infections in hospital settings, specifically in cases involving COVID-19 patients. This review also covers common CPs fabrication techniques. The key components to produce CPs at several possibilities to fit the current needs in fighting secondary bacterial infections are also discussed. © 2021, Qatar University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conducting polymers; COVID-19; Personal protective equipment (PPE); Secondary bacterial infections",

Bats are known to be the primary animal reservoir for coronaviruses. However, in the past few decades, the virus has been able to mutate and adapt to infect humans, resulting in an animal-to-human species barrier jump. The emergence of a novel coronavirus poses a serious global public health threat and possibly carries the potential of causing a major pandemic outbreak in the naïve human population. The recent outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has infected over 36.5 million individuals and claimed over one million lives worldwide, as of 8 October 2020. The novel virus is rapidly spreading across China and has been transmitted to 213 other countries/territories across the globe. Researchers have reported that the virus is constantly evolving and spreading through asymptomatic carriers, further suggesting a high global health threat. To this end, current up-to-date information on the coronavirus evolution and SARS-CoV-2 modes of transmission, detection techniques and current control and prevention strategies are summarized in this review. © 2021 by the authors.

Despite several control efforts invested in breaking the transmission chain of the disease, there is a rise in the number of reported infected and death cases around the world. Hence, there is the need for a mathematical model that can reliably describe the real nature of the transmission behaviour and control of the disease. This study presents an appropriately developed deterministic compartmental model to investigate the effect of different pharmaceutical (treatment therapies) and non-pharmaceutical (particularly, human personal protection and contact tracing and testing on the exposed individuals) control measures on COVID-19 population dynamics in Malaysia. The data from daily reported cases of COVID-19 between 3 March and 31 December 2020 are used to parameterize the model. The basic reproduction number of the model is estimated. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effect of various control combination strategies involving the use of personal protection, contact tracing and testing, and treatment control measures on the disease spread. Numerical simulations reveal that the implementation of each strategy analysed can significantly reduce COVID-19 incidence and prevalence in the population. However, the results of effectiveness analysis suggest that a strategy that combines both the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control measures averts the highest number of infections in the population. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,

This study aimed to compare the mental health status during the pandemic in the general population of seven middle income countries (MICs) in Asia (China, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam). All the countries used the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to measure mental health. There were 4479 Asians completed the questionnaire with demographic characteristics, physical symptoms and health service utilization, contact history, knowledge and concern, precautionary measure, and rated their mental health with the IES-R and DASS-21. Descriptive statistics, One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and linear regression were used to identify protective and risk factors associated with mental health parameters. There were significant differences in IES-R and DASS-21 scores between 7 MICs (p<0.05). Thailand had all the highest scores of IES-R, DASS-21 stress, anxiety, and depression scores whereas Vietnam had all the lowest scores. The risk factors for adverse mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic include age <30 years, high education background, single and separated status, discrimination by other countries and contact with people with COVID-19 (p<0.05). The protective factors for mental health include male gender, staying with children or more than 6 people in the same household, employment, confidence in doctors, high perceived likelihood of survival, and spending less time on health information (p<0.05).

Considering tourism’s contribution to Malaysia’s GDP, this study aims to examine vendors’ attitudes and perceptions towards international tourists in night markets after the emergence of COVID-19 and the impacts of propagation power of COVID-19 on vendors’ perceptions in Malaysia. As large numbers of informal workers lost 60% of their income worldwide due to the pandemic, a lack of research is observed on vendors’ attitudes after the pandemic, especially in Southeast Asia. The study model was derived on the basis of the revised social exchange theory (SET). A questionnaire survey was conducted among local vendors in Malaysia using a multistage probability sampling method. Findings revealed that place attachment has a significant effect on positive perception but not negative perception towards international tourists’ receptiveness. Results indicate that positive perceptions towards international tourists significantly and positively mediate the relationship among place attachment, economic gain, and involvement with tourist receptiveness. Moreover, the research concluded that vendors still have positive attitudes towards international tourists’ receptiveness due to economic gain and their place attachment and involvement levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, Banach and Leray-Schauder alternative type theorems are used to establish some appropriate conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Also, stability is needed in respect of the numerical solution. Therefore, Ulam-Hyers stability using nonlinear functional analysis is used for the proposed model. Moreover, the numerical simulation using the technique of fundamental theorem of fractional calculus and the two-step Lagrange polynomial known as fractional Adams-Bashforth (AB) method is proposed. The obtained results are tested on real data of COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia from 25 January till 10 May 2020. The numerical simulation of the proposed model has performed in terms of graphs for different fractional-order q and fractal dimensions p via number of considered days of disease spread in Malaysia. Since COVID-19 transmits rapidly, perhaps, the clear understanding of transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is important for countries to implement suitable strategies and restrictions such as Movement Control Order (MCO) by the Malaysian government, against the disease spread. The simulated results of the presented model demonstrate that movement control order has a great impact on the transmission dynamics of disease outbreak in Malaysia. It can be concluded that by adopting precautionary measures as restrictions on individual movement the transmission of the disease in society is reduced. In addition, for such type of dynamical study, fractal-fractional calculus tools may be used as powerful tools to understand and predict the global dynamics of the mentioned disease in other countries as well. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","COVID-19 Model; Fractal-Fractional Derivative; Fractional Adams-Bashforth (AB) Method; Fractional Calculus; Numerical Results; Ulam-Hyers Stability","Calculations; Dynamics; Fractal dimension; Functional analysis; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Transmissions; Existence and uniqueness; Fractional derivatives; Fundamental theorems; Lagrange polynomials; Malaysian governments; Nonlinear functional analysis; Precautionary measures; Transmission dynamics; Disease control"

A sub-sample of 535 individuals aged 52 years and above, from the earlier cohort and interventional studies (n = 4) from four selected states in Peninsular Malaysia, were recruited during the COVID-19 outbreak (April to June 2020). Telephone interviews were conducted by trained interviewers with a health sciences background to obtain participants’ information on health status, physical activity, food security, and psychological health (General Health Questionnaire-12; normal and psychological distress). Univariate analyses were performed for each variable, followed by a logistic regression analysis using SPSS Statistics version 25.0. Results revealed food insecurity (OR = 17.06, 95% CI: 8.24-35.32, p < 0.001), low protein (OR = 0.981, 95% CI: 0.965-0.998, p < 0.05), and fiber intakes (OR = 0.822, 95% CI: 0.695-0.972, p < 0.05) were found to be significant factors associated with the psychological distress group after adjusting for confounding factors. The findings suggested that food insecurity and insufficiencies of protein and fiber intakes heightened the psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Optimal nutrition is vital to ensure the physical and psychological health of the older population, specifically during the current pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.","COVID-19; Food insecurity; Nutrient intake; Older adults; Psychological distress","adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; community dwelling person; confounding variable; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; data analysis software; depression; Dietary History Questionnaire; distress syndrome; female; fiber intake; food insecurity; food security; General Health Questionnaire-12; Geriatric Depression Scale; health status; human; international physical activity questionnaire; intervention study; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; middle aged; nutrient intake; pandemic; physical activity; protein intake; psychological well-being; questionnaire; risk factor; telephone interview; univariate analysis; clinical trial; diagnosis; distress syndrome; economics; epidemiology; food insecurity; independent living; mental stress; multicenter study; nutritional status; patient health questionnaire; psychology; Aged; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Food Insecurity; Humans; Independent Living; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Pandemics; Patient Health Questionnaire; Psychological Distress; Stress, Psychological"

Stress influences health be-haviors, including those related to dietary behaviors, alcohol, and sleep; yet the effects of stress can be mitigated by resilience. To date, past research studying the connections between dietary behav-iors, alcohol misuse, sleep, and resilience commonly investigated singular relationships between two of the constructs. The aim of the current study was to explore the relationships between these constructs in a more holistic manner using mediation and moderation analyses. Methods: Higher education students from China, Ireland, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and the United States were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from April to May 2020, which was during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic for most participants. An online survey, using validated tools, was distributed to assess perceived stress, dietary behaviors, alcohol misuse, sleep quality and duration, and resilience. Results: 2254 students completed the study. Results indicated that sleep quality mediated the relationship between perceived stress and dietary behaviors as well as the relationship between perceived stress and alcohol misuse. Further, increased resilience reduced the strength of the relationship between perceived stress and dietary behaviors but not alcohol mis-use. Conclusion: Based on these results, higher education students are likely to benefit from sleep education and resilience training, especially during stressful events. © 2021 by the authors.

Furthermore, the rate of recovery from clinical COVID-19 in certain pockets of the globe is surprisingly high. Based on published reports and available literature, here, we speculated a few immunovirological mechanisms as to why a vast majority of individuals remain asymptomatic similar to exotic animal (bats and pangolins) reservoirs that remain refractile to disease development despite carrying a huge load of diverse insidious viral species, and whether such evolutionary advantage would unveil therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 infection in humans. Understanding the unique mechanisms that exotic animal species employ to achieve viral control, as well as inflammatory regulation, appears to hold key clues to the development of therapeutic versatility against COVID-19. © 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

This disease has stepped out to its greatest extent and is expanding day by day. Coronavirus, termed as a worldwide disease, has caused more than 8 lakh deaths worldwide. The foremost cause of the spread of coronavirus is SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which are part of the coronavirus family. Thus, predicting the patients suffering from such pandemic diseases would help to formulate the difference in inaccurate and infeasible time duration. This paper mainly focuses on the prediction of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 using the B-cells dataset. The paper also proposes different ensemble learning strategies that came out to be beneficial while making predictions. The predictions are made using various machine learning models. The numerous machine learning models, such as SVM, Naïve Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, AdaBoost, Gradient boosting, XGBoost, Random forest, ensembles, and neural networks are used in predicting and analyzing the dataset. The most accurate result was obtained using the proposed algorithm with 0.919 AUC score and 87.248% validation accuracy for predicting SARS-CoV and 0.923 AUC and 87.7934% validation accuracy for predicting SARS-CoV-2 virus. © 2021 The Author(s)","AdaBoost; B-cells; Coronavirus; COVD-19; Ensembles; Gradient boosting; K – nearest neighbors (KNN); Logistic regression; Multilayer perceptron (MLP); Naïve Bayes; Random forest; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; Support vector machine (SVM); XGBoost",

This observational study was carried out to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 on urological residencies across Asia. Methodology: An open-ended survey questionnaire examining key areas in a urology training program was distributed to several urologists in Asia. The survey evaluated seven areas including the burden of Covid-19 disease, the need for re-deployment of residents, the impact on clinical work, the effect on research work for residents, the delivery of teaching to the residents, the impact on training and assessments, the effects on mental, personal health and social welfare of residents. Results: Reports from 11 Asian countries were analysed. There is stark variability in Covid-19 disease burden across Asia. Re-deployment occurred in selected Asian countries. Affected residents reported challenges obtaining personal protective equipment and training. Clinical workload and research were generally reduced except for countries reporting low volume Covid-19 cases. Residents teaching evolved from in-person to online platforms. Almost all residency program postponed their examinations. Mental health disturbance was more pronounced than personal health. Conclusions: The Covid-19 pandemic presented multiple obstacles to Asian urology residencies. The understanding of these challenges will assist program directors in developing mitigating measures. © 2020 College of Surgeons of Hong Kong","Covid-19; pandemic; residency; urology","anxiety; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; health; human; human experiment; learning; medical practice; medical student; mental health; multicenter study; observational study; propensity score; prostate biopsy; questionnaire; residency education; resuscitation; social status; social welfare; surgical training; teaching; teleconsultation; transrectal ultrasonography; urodynamics; uroflowmetry; urologist; urology; workload"

Its efficacy as a barrier protection in addition to the use of a standard personal protective equipment (PPE) is not fully known. We performed a simulated study to investigate the relationship between aerosol box usage during intubation and contaminations on healthcare workers pre-doffing and post-doffing of PPE. Methods This was a randomised cross-over study conducted between 9 April to 5 May 2020 in the ED of University Malaya Medical Centre. Postgraduate Emergency Medicine trainees performed video laryngoscope-assisted intubation on an airway manikin with and without an aerosol box in a random order. Contamination was simulated by nebulised Glo Germ. Primary outcome was number of contaminated front and back body regions pre-doffing and post-doffing of PPE of the intubator and assistant. Secondary outcomes were intubation time, Cormack-Lehane score, number of intubation attempts and participants' feedback. Results Thirty-six trainees completed the study interventions. The number of contaminated front and back body regions pre-doffing of PPE was significantly higher without the aerosol box (all p values<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the number of contaminations post-doffing of PPE between using and not using the aerosol box, with a median contamination of zero. Intubation time was longer with the aerosol box (42.5 s vs 35.5 s, p<0.001). Cormack-Lehane scores were similar with and without the aerosol box. First-pass intubation success rate was 94.4% and 100% with and without the aerosol box, respectively. More participants reported reduced mobility and visibility when intubating with the aerosol box. Conclusions An aerosol box may significantly reduce exposure to contaminations but with increased intubation time and reduced operator's mobility and visibility. Furthermore, the difference in degree of contamination between using and not using an aerosol box could be offset by proper doffing of PPE. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

This disease spread to 215 countries affecting a wide range of people. World health organization (WHO) called it a pandemic and it was officially named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2 (SARS CoV-2), also known as Corona virus disease (COVID-19). This pandemic compelled countries to enforce a socio-economic lockdown to prevent its widespread. This paper focuses on how the particulate matter pollution was reduced during the lockdown period (23 March to April 15, 2020) as compared to before lockdown. Both ground-based and satellite observations were used to identify the improvement in air quality of Pakistan with primary focus on four major cities of Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar. Both datasets have shown a substantial reduction in PM2.5 pollution levels (ranging from 13% to 33% in case of satellite observations, while 23%–58% in ground-based observations) across Pakistan. Result shows a higher rate of COVID-19 spread in major cities of Pakistan with poor air quality conditions. Yet more research is needed in order to establish linkage between COVID-19 spread and air pollution. However, it can be partially attributed to both higher rate of population density and frequent exposure of population to enhanced levels of PM2.5 concentrations before lockdown period. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"air quality; disease prevalence; disease spread; disease transmission; particulate matter; pneumonia; population density; satellite altimetry; socioeconomic status; viral disease; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; carbon footprint; climate; coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; ecosystem; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; noise pollution; nonhuman; optical depth; Pakistan; particulate matter 2.5; population density; priority journal; radiative forcing; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social status; suspended particulate matter; virus transmission; waste management; World Health Organization; air pollutant; China; city; communicable disease control; epidemiology; human; particulate matter; socioeconomics; China; Hubei; Islamabad; Karachi; Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa; Lahore; Pakistan; Peshawar; Punjab [Pakistan]; Sind; Wuhan; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pakistan; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2; Socioeconomic Factors"

The concerned model is composed of eight compartments: susceptible, exposed, infected, super-spreaders, asymptomatic, hospitalized, recovery and fatality. When, choosing the fractal order one we obtain fractional order, and when choosing the fractional order one a fractal system is obtained. Considering both the operators together we present a model with fractal-fractional. Under the new derivative the existence and uniqueness of the solution for considered model are proved using Schaefer's and Banach type fixed point approaches. Additionally, with the help of nonlinear functional analysis, the condition for Ulam's type of stability of the solution to the considered model is established. For numerical simulation of proposed model, a fractional type of two-step Lagrange polynomial known as fractional Adams-Bashforth (AB) method is applied to simulate the results. At last, the results are tested with real data from COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China from 4 January to 9 March 2020, taken from a source (Ndaïrou, 2020).

This study aims to investigate the temporal trend in (1) avoidance and protective behaviors, (2) fear, (3) socio-economic impact, and (4) anxiety levels during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a high level of anxiety may have a detrimental impact during an infectious disease outbreak, factors associated with anxiety were also explored. The survey was carried out for 10 weeks and the responses were divided into three periods of around 3 weeks: 25 January–21 February, 22 February–17 March and 18 March–3 April (the period the Malaysian Government issued Movement Control Order). Findings revealed that most of the pyschobehavioural variables showed small increases during first (25 January–21 February) and second (22 February–17 March) periods, and high psychobehavioral responses were reported during the third period. A total of 72.1% (95%CI = 69.2–75.0) reported moderate to severe anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Factor influencing moderate to severe anxiety is a high perception of severity (OR = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.48–2.94), high perceived susceptibility (OR = 1.71; 95%CI = 1.17–2.50), high impact score (OR = 1.63; 95%CI = 1.17–2.26) and high fear score (OR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.01–2.14). In conclusion, the psychological and behavioural responses were found to increase with the progression of the outbreak. High anxiety levels found in this study warrant provision of mental health intervention during the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Malaysia; Psychobehavioural; SARS-CoV-2; Temporal changes","adult; anxiety; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; fear; female; human; Internet; Malaysia; male; pandemic; physiology; prevention and control; psychology; questionnaire; time factor; Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fear; Female; Humans; Internet; Malaysia; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors"

A number of anti-viral drugs such as ribavirin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline, and anti-parasite such as ivermectin have been recommended for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, Zn has the ability to enhance innate and adaptive immunity in the course of a viral infection. Besides, Zn supplement can favour COVID-19 treatment using those suggested and/or recommended drugs. Again, the effectiveness of Zn can be enhanced by using chloroquine as an ionophore while Zn inside the infected cell can stop SARS-CoV-2 replication.

The common symptoms include fever, cough, and fatigue. This paper focus on proposing a solution that can help detect the virus and keep people away from the infected person. The solution uses a Thermal Camera, which has a heat sensor and can detect any difference in temperature, and the camera can be integrated with access control systems in many places like Hospitals, Police stations, Factories, Universities, etc. which has staff walking in daily. The camera will not allow access to the person having high body temperature as fever is a symptom for COVID-19 and that person can be further examined for the virus.

Design/methodology/approach: The partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for the analysis. Data were drawn from 152 Facebook and WhatsApp users in Nigeria to examine the research model formulated using the uses and gratification theory (UGT). Findings: We found that altruism, instant news sharing, socialisation and self-promotion predicted fake news sharing related to COVID-19 pandemic among social media users in Nigeria. Specifically, altruism was the strongest predictor to fake news sharing behaviour related to COVID-19, followed by instant news sharing and socialisation. On the contrary, entertainment had no association with fake news sharing on COVID-19. Practical implications: We suggest intervention strategies which nudge people to be sceptical of the information they come across on social media. We also recommend healthcare providers and the Nigerian government to provide relevant information on this current pandemic. That is, correct information should be shared widely to the public domain through various conventional and online media. This will lessen the spread of fake news on the concocted cure and prevention tips found online. Originality/value: The salient contributions of this study are as follows: First, it brings to the fore that the desire for self-promotion is associated with fake news sharing on social media; second, it shifts the focus of studies on fake news from detection methods to sharing behaviour, which fuels the uncontrollable spread of falsehood; third, it expands the existing literature on misinformation sharing by demonstrating the user motivation that leads to fake news sharing using the UGT. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Fake news; Fake news sharing; Nigeria; Social media users","Least squares approximations; Motivation; Social networking (online); Design/methodology/approach; Detection methods; Health care providers; Intervention strategy; Partial least square (PLS); Predictive modeling; Structural equation modelling; Uses and gratification theories; Predictive analytics"

It aims to demonstrate how facilities management (FM) services delivery in public hospitals can be improved for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: This paper embraces a review of current literature on COVID-19 and FM together with credible media updates. The paper critically synthesizes knowledge on the pandemic to position a technical view on how FM can be improved in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges and realities to the health-care system of most African countries. Despite the significant efforts being made by various governments, there appears to be a lack of a coherent and strategic FM plan to fight the pandemic. To create the necessary antivirus built environment, actionable and timely FM interventions are needed. Research limitations/implications: The report herein is case guarded, based on the prevailing data and information as at the time of writing the paper. Nevertheless, the recommendations from the paper are useful for a worse future trajectory of the pandemic. Practical implications: Knowledge of the proposed interventions will inform and assist health-care facilities managers in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: The paper presents the first step towards encapsulating knowledge on FM and the COVID-19 pandemic. It sets forth recommendations that are useful for most developing countries’ public hospitals’ FM practices in the fight against this global pandemic.

"Computational study on peptidomimetic inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097719516&doi=10.1016%2fj.molliq.2020.114999&partnerID=40&md5=1f4b6af9b3d7da66191c6bbe9495c8f3","The emergence outbreak caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has received significant attention on the global risks. Due to itscrucial role in viral replication, the main protease 3CLpro is an important target for drug discovery and development to combat COVID-19. In this work, the structural and dynamic behaviors as well as binding efficiency of the four peptidomimetic inhibitors (N3, 11a, 13b, and 14b) recently co-crystalized with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were studied and compared using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solvated interaction energy-based binding free energy calculations. The per-residue decomposition free energy results suggested that the key residues involved in inhibitors binding were H41, M49, L141–C145, H163–E166, P168, and Q189–T190 in the domains I and II. The van der Waals interaction yielded the main energy contribution stabilizing all the focused inhibitors. Besides, their hydrogen bond formations with F140, G143, C145, H164, E166, and Q189 residues in the substrate-binding pocket were also essential for strengthening the molecular complexation. The predicted binding affinity of the four peptidomimetic inhibitors agreed with the reported experimental data, and the 13b showed the most efficient binding to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. From rational drug design strategies based on 13b, the polar moieties (e.g., benzamide) and the bulky N-terminal protecting groups (e.g., thiazole) should be introduced to P1’ and P4 sites in order to enhance H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions, respectively. We hope that the obtained structural and energetic information could be beneficial for developing novel SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors with higher inhibitory potency to combat COVID-19. © 2020","COVID-19; MD simulations; Peptidomimetic inhibitors; SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro","Amides; Diseases; Free energy; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrophobicity; Molecular dynamics; Van der Waals forces; Hydrogen-bond formation; Hydrophobic interactions; Molecular complexation; Molecular dynamics simulations; Rational drug designs; Residue decomposition; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Van Der Waals interactions; Binding energy"

However, there has been considerable controversy surrounding some treatments including hydroxychloroquine where the initial hype and misinformation led to shortages, price rises and suicides. Price rises and shortages were also seen for PPE. Such activities can have catastrophic consequences especially in countries with high co-payment levels. Consequently, there is a need to investigate this further. Objective: Assess changes in utilisation, prices, and shortages of pertinent medicines and PPE among African and Asian countries since the start of pandemic. Our approach: Data gathering among community pharmacists to assess changes in patterns from the beginning of March until principally the end of May 2020. In addition, suggestions on ways to reduce misinformation. Results: One hundred and thirty one pharmacists took part building on the earlier studies across Asia. There were increases in the utilisation of principally antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine) and antibiotics (azithromycin) especially in Nigeria and Ghana. There were limited changes in Namibia and Vietnam reflecting current initiatives to reduce inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antimicrobials. Encouragingly, there was increased use of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE across the countries where documented. In addition, generally limited change in the utilisation of herbal medicines. However, shortages have resulted in appreciable price increases in some countries although moderated in others through government initiatives. Suggestions in Namibia going forward included better planning and educating patients. Conclusion: Encouraging to see increases in the utilisation of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE. However, concerns with increased utilisation of antimicrobials needs addressing alongside misinformation, unintended consequences from the pandemic and any appreciable price rises. Community pharmacists and patient organisations can play key roles in providing evidence-based advice, helping moderate prices through improved stock management, and helping address unintended consequences of the pandemic. © Copyright © 2021 Sefah, Ogunleye, Essah, Opanga, Butt, Wamaitha, Guantai, Chikowe, Khuluza, Kibuule, Nambahu, Abubakar, Sani, Saleem, Kalungia, Thi Phuong, Haque, Islam, Kumar, Sneddon, Wamboga, Wale, Miljkovi´c, Kurdi, Martin and Godman.","Africa; Asia; community pharmacists; COVID-19; medicines; price rises; protective equipment; shortages","azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; African; Article; Asian; community pharmacist; coronavirus disease 2019; device shortage; health care cost; health care utilization; human; pandemic"

However, there are concerns with treatment recommendations given the extent of conflicting results with suggested treatments and misinformation, some of which has resulted in increased prices and shortages alongside increasing use and prices of personal protective equipment (PPE). This is a concern in countries such as India where there have been high patient co-payments and an appreciable number of families going into poverty when members become ill. However, balanced against pricing controls. Community pharmacists play a significant role in disease management in India, and this will remain. Consequently, there is a need to review prices and availability of pertinent medicines during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in India to provide future direction. Objective: Assess current utilisation and price changes as well as shortages of pertinent medicines and equipment during the early stages of the pandemic. Our Approach: Multiple approach involving a review of treatments and ongoing activities across India to reduce the spread of the virus alongside questioning pharmacies in selected cities from early March to end May 2020. Our Activities: 111 pharmacies took part, giving a response rate of 80%. Encouragingly, no change in utilisation of antimalarial medicines in 45% of pharmacies despite endorsements and for antibiotics in 57.7% of pharmacies, helped by increasing need for a prescription for dispensing. In addition, increased purchasing of PPE (over 98%). No price increases were seen for antimalarials and antibiotics in 83.8 and 91.9% of pharmacies respectively although shortages were seen for antimalarials in 70.3% of pharmacies, lower for antibiotics (9.9% of pharmacies). However, price increases were typically seen for PPE (over 90% of stores) as well as for analgesics (over 50% of pharmacies). Shortages were also seen for PPE (88.3%). Conclusion: The pandemic has impacted on utilisation and prices of pertinent medicines and PPE in India but moderated by increased scrutiny. Key stakeholder groups can play a role with enhancing evidenced-based approaches and reducing inappropriate purchasing in the future. © Copyright © 2021 Haque, Kumar, Charan, Bhatt, Islam, Dutta, Abhayanand, Sharma, Sefah, Kurdi, Wale and Godman.","community pharmacists; India; lower- and middle-income countries; medicines; price rises; protective equipment; shortages","antibiotic agent; antimalarial agent; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; drug cost; evidence based medicine; health care availability; health care quality; health care utilization; health impact assessment; human; India; medical resource shortage; misinformation; pandemic; pharmacy (shop); prescription; price; risk factor; social media; virus transmission"

HLBDA is an enhanced version of the Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (BDA) in which a hyper learning strategy is used to assist the algorithm to escape local optima and improve searching behavior. The proposed HLBDA is compared with eight algorithms in the literature. Several assessment indicators are employed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these methods over twenty-one datasets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) repository and Arizona State University.

The aim of this study was to determine factors that could possibly affect the acceptance of Indonesian citizens of COVID-19 vaccination using a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a model how users come to accept and use a technology. Methods: An online survey was conducted between the first and fifth of November, 2020. Participants were asked to respond to questions on acceptance, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived religiosity towards, and amount of information about COVID-19. This study used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the framework to decide factors that affect vaccine acceptance. Structural Equation Model was employed to assess the correlation between all explanatory variables and vaccine acceptance. Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis rank were employed to assess demographic factors associated with acceptance. Results: In total, 311 responses were included for analysis. Our TAM model suggested that high perceived usefulness significantly increased COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and high perceived ease of use significantly increased the perceived usefulness. Perceived religiosity did not substantially affect vaccine acceptance. The amount of information on COVID-19 also did not significantly affect vaccine acceptance. Our data suggested that vaccine acceptance was associated with age, type of occupation, marital status and monthly income to some degree. Conclusion: Since perceived usefulness affects vaccine acceptance, the government should focus on the usefulness of the vaccine when promoting the COVID-19 vaccine to Indonesian citizens. In addition, since perceived ease of use significantly affects users' acceptance to COVID-19 vaccine, the easier to acquire the vaccine in the community, the higher chance that the citizens are willing to be vaccinated. © 2021 Faturohman T et al.","Acceptance; COVID-19 vaccine; Indonesia; Technology acceptance model",

Nursing students turning away from the nursing profession upon graduation may exacerbate nursing workforce shortfalls. The main objective of this study was to assess perceived occupational turnover intention among nursing students and associated factors (fear of COVID-19 and life satisfaction). Students were also asked to provide suggestions that could enhance their intention to join the nursing profession. Methods: An online survey was sent to all registered undergraduate nursing students at Fujian Medical University, China. The partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was used to investigate key factors influencing turnover intention. Results: A total of 1020 complete responses were received (response rate: 86.2%). Nearly half (49.1%) reported that they would choose not to be on a nursing course if given a choice, 45.4% often think of not going into the nursing profession in the future, and 23.7% would consider entering a healthcare industry that has zero contact with patients. The total turnover intention score range was 3 to 15, and the mean ± standard deviation (SD) was 9.2 (SD ± 2.5). PLS-SEM path analysis revealed that fear of COVID-19 (β = 0.226, p < 0.001) had a positive effect on turnover intention. Satisfaction with life (β = −0.212, p < 0.001) had a negative effect on turnover intention. Analysis of open-ended survey data on students’ perspectives on how to encourage nursing students to enter the nursing workforce revealed five central themes: 1) professional role, respect, and recognition; 2) higher wages; 3) reduce workload; 4) enhance occupational health and safety; and 5) career advancement opportunities. Conclusion: Factors influencing turnover intention and suggestions to reduce students’ apprehension towards joining the nursing profession found in this study should be seriously taken into consideration in initiatives to address the nurse shortages. © 2021 Lin et al.","Chinese nursing students; Fear of COVID-19; Life satisfaction; Psychological reactions; Turnover intention",

Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of virtual data collection for a longitudinal study of aging assessing cognitive frailty in a middle-income Southeast Asian country. Methods: The Transforming Cognitive Frailty into Later-Life Self-Sufficiency (AGELESS) longitudinal study of aging involved community-dwelling participants aged 60 years and above. A semi-structured focus group discussion was conducted via videoconferencing with selected representatives from existing participants. The survey instrument was compiled during a hybrid meeting and refined using a virtual Delphi process involving 51 AGELESS investigators. The final draft survey and recruitment strategy were then piloted among selected participants. Results: Twelve individuals participated in the virtual focus group interview. Smartphone, tablet computer, laptops, and desktop personal computers were used for information gathering, communication, banking, shopping, leisure, religion, and education, within this group. The survey instrument was redacted from 362 items in 18 sections to 141 items in 12 sections through 3 virtual Delphi rounds facilitated by email, social media messaging, and videoconferencing which attracted 213 comments. Of 45 participants selected for the pilot survey, 30 were successfully contacted after one attempt and 18 completed the survey. Cognitive frailty was present in 13%, cognitive impairment in 20%, frailty in 20%, and 47% were robust. Conclusion: A virtual survey instrument was developed for the AGELESS longitudinal survey of aging which was vital for determining the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our older population as well as sustaining research into aging despite barriers posed by the pandemic. © 2021 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: This descriptive case study is primarily based on analysing data collected from various texts, public statements, media interviews and three semi-structured interviews with key members involved in the Covid-19 dashboard project. Findings: The data and analysis reviews that both interpersonal and interorganisational trust, dedication and proactiveness of the leaders at SCC were major contributing factors to why SCC was able to partner with the Hong Kong Government in the Covid-19 dashboard in the first place and that the success was also a direct outcome of effective mass collaborative knowledge management activities. Research limitations/implications: The research in leadership attributes and activities in the non-profit alliance has been few and this collaborative partnership between the alliance and the government is an example of the importance of further research in smart city leadership. Practical implications: In deploying projects for mass collaboration and knowledge sharing in smart city development (which is multi-disciplinary in nature). there are still many new and evolving organisational practices and leadership matters that many business leaders and city managers can learn from. Social implications: Smart city development projects involve the notion of sharing data in an open environment enabled by software and mediating tools. Successful projects such as this Hong Kong Covid-19 dashboard which serves a diverse audience can further promote the importance of an open data policy regime for the benefit of the public.

A sizeable amount of scholarly work has been available on different aspects of social-economic and environmental factors. At the same time, many of these studies found the linear (direct) causation between the stated factors. In many cases, the direct relationship is not apparent. The world is unsure about the possible determining factors of the COVID-19 pandemic, which need to be known through conducting nonlinearity (indirect) relationships, which caused the pandemic crisis. The study examined the nonlinear relationship between COVID-19 cases and carbon damages, managing financial development, renewable energy consumption, and innovative capability in a cross section of 65 countries. The results show that inbound foreign direct investment first increases and later decreases because of the increasing coronavirus cases. Further, the rise and fall in the research and development expenditures and population density exhibits increasing coronavirus cases across countries. The continued economic growth initial decreases later increase by adopting standardized operating procedures to contain coronavirus disease. The inter-temporal relationship shows that green energy source and carbon damages would likely influence the coronavirus cases with a variance of 17.127% and 5.440%, respectively, over a time horizon. The policymakers should be carefully designing sustainable healthcare policies, as the cost of carbon emissions leads to severe healthcare issues, which are likely to get exposed to contagious diseases, including COVID-19. The sustainable policy instruments, including renewable fuels in industrial production, advancement in cleaner production technologies, the imposition of carbon taxes on dirty production, and environmental certifications, are a few possible remedies that achieve healthcare sustainability agenda globally. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon damages; COVID-19 pandemic; Financial development; Population density; Renewable energy consumption; Switching regression",
"Does green finance matter for sustainable entrepreneurship and environmental corporate social responsibility during COVID-19?",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113699384&doi=10.1108%2fCFRI-02-2021-0038&partnerID=40&md5=9c15bef6f731d8ee8d87172fa87a326c","Purpose: The discourse aimed to investigate green finance practices under the assumptions of several notable climate advisors and speculators in Asia and particularly in Southeast Asia. The study intrigues by considering financial specialists to vent government spending on green restoration plans leading toward green bankable venture openings for the public and private sector. This section distinguishes a few of the green fund components and approaches that can be joined by national and neighborhood governments, essentially in Southeast Asia, into their post-COVID-19 techniques, but are too valuable inputs for domestic commercial banks and private corporates. Design/methodology/approach: It can be defined as a functional type for Cobb Douglas development. ARDL technology is a way of calculating complex forces at the classification level at long-term and short-term stages. This ARDL approach has many advantages and can be implemented when incorporated in level I (0) and level I first (1) with the original variable. Still, it offers robust ability to the outcomes and standardizes the lag, considering the number and sample size used. Pooled mean group (PMG) method is becoming a convenient technique for monitoring data over the period and a good approach for energy impact panels – growth ties for creating links between energy emissions and environmental sustainability and businesses in the nation. Findings: There is a positive partnership between creativity and a sustainable world. Corporations are recommended to uphold the principles of CSR in the development process by introducing environmentally friendly advanced technologies. The main objectives of corporate social responsibility (CSR) are economic growth, environmental sustainability and social justice. Several programs have been established to expand businesses' responsibilities to improve their confessions in sustainable growth. SMEs are a primary source of production of innovative products and technologies. The key concerns of stakeholders and politicians in the new competitive business climate are the protection of environmental sustainability and social responsibility, recognizing factors driving economic development for SMEs. Originality/value: During the COVID-19 era, the prime responsibility of pandemic confronting governments is to spend on help activities (that have been started in earlier phase) and recovery endeavors (yet to start in the situation). Therefore, the governments may devise policies to pool resources from commercial, private, public-private partnerships and other capital market sources. With rising hazard recognitions particularly emerging from at-threat income projections, governments ought to make the correct mechanisms and instruments that can perform this catalytic part of derisking and drawing in such capital. This too can be an opportunity for governments to enhance and execute such financial instruments that offer assistance, quicken their commitments to climate alter beneath the Paris Agreement and the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and thus “build back better” is being progressively voiced over the world. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ecological emission Kuznets curve; Ecological enterprises; Sustainability growth",

From the PsyCorona database, we obtained longitudinal data from 23 countries, collected between March and May 2020. The results demonstrated that although online contacts help to reduce feelings of loneliness, people who feel more lonely are less likely to use that strategy. Solidarity played only a small role in shaping feelings of loneliness during lockdown. Thus, it seems we must look beyond the current focus on online contact and solidarity to help people address feelings of loneliness during lockdown. Finally, online contacts did not function as a substitute for face-to-face contacts outside the home—in fact, more frequent online contact in earlier weeks predicted more frequent face-to-face contacts in later weeks. As such, this work provides relevant insights into how individuals manage the impact of restrictions on their social lives. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","COVID-19; loneliness; longitudinal methodology; online communication; solidarity",

Given the interpersonal nature of stress and coping responses between romantic partners, based on the systemic transactional model this study posits that perceived partner dyadic coping may be an important moderator between experiences of COVID-19 psychological distress and relationship quality. To examine these associations, self-report data from 14,020 people across 27 countries were collected during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic (March–July, 2020). It was hypothesized that higher symptoms of psychological distress would be reported post-COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 restrictions (Hypothesis 1), reports of post-COVID-19 psychological distress would be negatively associated with relationship quality (Hypothesis 2), and perceived partner DC would moderate these associations (Hypothesis 3).

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 186 private university students was enrolled in this cross-sectional study using a combination of snowball and purposive sampling approaches. Anthropometric measurements, including body height, body weight before and during the MCO enforcement were self-reported by the respondents. Screen-time based sedentary behaviour sedentary behaviour was evaluated using HELENA sedentary behaviour questionnaire, whereas the Self-Regulation of Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (SREBQ) was used to determine the eating self-regulatory skills in MCO. Findings: Respondents spent most of the time on the internet for non-study purposes (148 ± 77.7 min). It is also noted that 64.5% of the respondents had medium eating self-regulatory skill during the MCO, with an average score of 3.0 ± 0.5. Findings from path analysis confirmed that poor eating self-regulation significantly contributed to the weight gain during home confinement (ß = −0.24, p = 0.01). In conclusion, eating self-regulation, but not total screen time, emerged as the determinant for weight gain during the COVID-19 lockdown.

We perform wavelet-based time–frequency techniques and measure the market volatility with continuous wavelet transforms. Besides, we use wavelet coherency to understand the co-movement of economic activities and energy markets and employ a nonlinear phase-difference technique to understand the time-varying causality between different series. Our continuous wavelet transform results show that all three market indices experience significant volatility in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) period, notably during the initial period of the outbreak. The market volatilities are comparatively more substantial in the lower frequency band than the upper frequency, while the latter sustained longer in the markets. Moreover, wavelet coherency results show a strong correlation between the economic activity index and both energy market indices; however, the co-movement is significantly higher for the conventional energy market than the clean energy market. We further detect a positive and bi-directional causality between economic activities and energy market indices. Besides providing fresh and time-varying and frequency-varying relationship between global economic activities and the energy markets, which is currently lacking in the existing literature, our study has significant implications for the heterogeneous market participants in terms of improved price prediction accuracy. Furthermore, our findings can aid policymakers in decision making by showing that the dynamics between energy markets and economic activities change even within a short period, and imply that suitable constant policy interventions are necessary to avoid long-term predicament. © The Author(s) 2021.","Clean energy; Coronavirus; Coronavirus disease 2019; Economic activity; Energy markets; Pandemic; Time–frequency analysis; Wavelet analysis","Decision making; Energy policy; Wavelet transforms; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Economic activities; Frequency Analysis; Frequency techniques; Global economic activity; Heterogeneous markets; Policy intervention; Strong correlation; Power markets"

Different suggestions on possibilities to control the spread of the virus have been advanced in recent times. Nonpharmaceutical approaches such as partial lockdown, total lockdown, and social distancing have been adopted to reduce the spread of the Covid-19. This study focused on how effective social distancing is to curtail the spread of Covid-19. The objective of this study is to determine the social distancing value measured in meters that could help reduce the spread of the virus. In this study, we proposed a prediction model based on social distancing value and height to investigate whether social distancing will help curtail the spread of the virus. The model is classified as detection and prediction phases. The prediction phase utilizes information from the detection phase to analyse the effect of social distancing value on the spread of Covid-19. The study revealed that as the social distancing value increases, the probability of spread decreases. The result also showed that as the social distancing values increases, the probability of safety from been infected increases.

The results of the questionnaire indicated that the onset on the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital marketing among furniture manufacturers of all sizes. Larger manufacturers had the financial means to make greater investments into digital marketing to utilize it compared to the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Digital marketing by website, email, and social media were the most common mediums used by furniture manufacturers. As for social media applications, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were the common platforms used by furniture manufacturers. Although some furniture manufacturers were familiar with digital marketing, many were not using it effectively due to a lack of skilled workers with the ability to manage such digital marketing tools.

Limited case series involving critically ill patients have been reported from South East Asia. Methods: This is a single center, retrospective case series involving 49 ventilated critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to Hospital Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia admitted between 7th March until 16th April 2020. Inclusion criteria are COVID-19 adult patients age more than 12 years old, with history of intubation during their intensive care unit (ICU) stay and admitted between 7th March until 16th April. Data were obtained from electronic health record and ICU progress sheet. Results: Forty-nine ventilated COVID-19 patients were included {mean 60.2 [standard deviation (SD): 9.3], range: 42-79, male 75.5%}. Most common comorbidities were hypertension 30 (61%), diabetes 26 (53%) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) 8 (16%). Mean PaO2/FiO2 (PF) ratio on admission was 115 reflecting severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Fourteen (28.6%) patients required prone ventilation. Patients were intubated for an average of 10 (SD: 8.3) days. All patients received antiviral therapies. The more severely ill patients received either corticosteroid [dexamethasone 11 (22.4%), methylprednisolone 12 (24.5%)] or tocilizumab 8 (16.3%). During their illness, 32 (65.3%) patients developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with 23 (46.9%) patients needing renal replacement therapy (RRT). Average ICU stay is 18 (SD: 10.2) days. Thirty-one patients (57%) managed to be extubated and discharged from ICU while 9 (18.3%) succumbed to death. Conclusions: The majority of ventilated critically COVID-19 patients survived their ICU stay but often suffered from multiorgan complications. © Journal of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine.

First, from analysis point of view, existence is necessary to be investigated for any applied problem. Therefore, we used fixed point theorem's due to Banach's and Schaefer's to establish some sufficient results regarding existence and uniqueness of the solution to the proposed model. On the other hand, stability is important in respect of approximate solution, so we have developed condition sufficient for the stability of Ulam–Hyers and their different types for the considered system. In addition, the model has also been considered for semianalytical solution via Laplace Adomian decomposition method (LADM).

To date, about 123,498 million cases have been reported worldwide and about 2.71 million deaths were reported. This newly discovered pandemic has majorly impacted many things such as tourism, the economy, and others. Because of this, low-income households (also known as B40) seem to be affected. Through a survey conducted online in the state of Pahang, Malaysia, this study aims to examine the level of depression, anxiety, and stress faced by B40 households. The study extracted data from 128 respondents (N=128) from B40 households around the state by using the DASS-21 online form. The result of the study showed that 31% respondents had moderate depression, 40% had severe depression, and 22% had extremely severe depression. Moreover, 15% respondents had moderate anxiety, 16% had severe anxiety, and 68% had extremely severe anxiety. The result also showed that 31% respondents had moderate stress, 36% had severe stress, and 18% had extremely severe stress. All scores were tabulated from the administration of the Depression, Stress, and Anxiety Scale (DASS-21) inventory. The result showed that the government sector and self-employed groups differed slightly at p<0.051. Regardless of the employment sector within B40 respondents, this study showed that they are prone to have mental health issues especially depression, anxiety, and stress. The limitation of this study is the sample size.

Drawing from an Indigenous understanding of illness and health, the Orang Asli took the threat of the pandemic seriously and responded with proactive steps to keep their community safe, which included setting up barricades and checkpoints to control movement into their villages, performing health maintenance rituals and prayers and retreating into the forest. We argue that the Orang Asli’s response mitigated the spread of the virus into their villages. Their adaptation and resilience emphasize the need to respect their traditional knowledge and way of life, as well as the importance of strengthening the Orang Asli’s control over their traditional territories and environment. © The Author(s) 2021.","COVID-19; Indigenous knowledge; Malaysia; Orang Asli; pandemic",

Here, the virus microRNA from the N-gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was used for the first time as a specific target for detecting the virus and became a framework for developing the complementary DNA probe. The sequence analysis of the virus microRNA was carried out using bioinformatics tools including basic local alignment search tools, multiple sequence alignment from CLUSTLW, microRNA database (miRbase), microRNA target database, and gene analysis. Cross-validation of distinct strains of coronavirus and human microRNA sequences was completed to validate the percentage of identical and consent regions. The percent identity parameter from the bioinformatics tools revealed the virus microRNAs’ sequence has a 100% match with the genome of SARS-CoV-2 compared with other coronavirus strains, hence improving the selectivity of the complementary DNA probe. The 30 mer with 53.0% GC content of complementary DNA probe 5′ GCC TGA GTT GAG TCA GCA CTG CTC ATG GAT 3′ was designed and could be used as a bioreceptor for the biosensor development in the clinical and environmental diagnosis of COVID-19. © 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","Biomarker; biosensor; DNA probe; In silco analysis; microRNA; SARS-CoV-2","Bioinformatics; Biosensors; Diagnosis; Diseases; DNA; Genes; Oligonucleotides; Probes; Viruses; Basic local alignment search tools; Bioinformatics tools; DNA electrochemical biosensor; Environmental diagnosis; Multiple sequence alignments; Sensing components; Sequence analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; RNA"

This paper studies the online modest fashion small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Egypt as a Muslim country. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on the social cognitive theory (SCT) and the literature to develop a theoretical framework of the factors influencing customers’ value co-creation intention on social media. The framework is then tested quantitatively through structural equation modelling based on partial least squares method (SEM-PLS) approach using the SmartPLS software. Findings: The empirical analysis supported the SCT through the following conclusions: first, regarding the subject factors, self-efficacy has a positive significant effect on all dimensions of customer engagement and outcome expectation has a positive significant effect on cognitive customer engagement. Concerning the environmental factors, community experience has a positive significant effect on affective and behavioural customer engagement, whereas content quality has a positive significant effect on affective customer engagement. Second, customer engagement is a significant mediator through the dimensions of affective and behavioural customer engagement. Practical implications: The findings of this study can help online modest fashion SMEs better comprehend the factors which influence the customers’ engagement for value co-creation intention whether it is subject factors or environmental factors. Therefore, they can better operate online and encourage customers to contribute to the development of new products and services and hence achieve a competitive advantage and survive in times of COVID-19. Originality/value: Most of the existing studies focused on the value co-creation behaviour and output. However, there is limited research focusing on what contributes to the customers’ engagement for value co-creation intention, especially for online modest fashion and Muslim countries. Therefore, this study attempts to examine and bridge this research gap. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Customer engagement; Online modest fashion; Social cognitive theory; Value co-creation",

Its pollution is exacerbated recently by the exces-sive use of plastic polymers to prevent and handle the COVID-19 pandemic at a global scale. This review covered the major concerns about the characteristics, effect, and bioremediation of micro-and nano plastics. Many aquatic organisms easily ingest mi-cro-and nano plastic at different trophic levels. This ingestion caused negative health impacts to all living organisms. Microplastic directly affects living organisms like mechanical injury, false satiation, declined growth, promoted immune response, and energy loss. Other debilitating effects include disrupted enzyme activity and produc-tion, decreased fecundity, oxidative stress, and mortality. Nano plastic could enter the circulatory system and caused negative effects on the cellular and molecular levels. Bioremediation of microplastic by selected higher and lower eukaryotes, bacteria, fun-gus, and algae on several polymers was previously reported. However, not much lit-erature is available on nano plastic biodegradation. Therefore, the current review will focus on the characteristics, effect, and bioremediation effort of micro-and nano plas-tic. © 2021, Brawijaya University.

From its roots in China, the pandemic has swiftly created a chain reaction around the world as the greater interdependence of the global community has taken its toll. This article takes the position that the COVID-19 pandemic is trending towards a de-globalisation of the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has raised serious rethinking on many aspects of social culture such as health care and human-to-human interactions. But global governance has been severely impacted, and this is profound in great power competition, geo-economics, and maritime governance. This essay is structured in three parts. The first explores the impacts of COVID-19 on globalisation, the second looks at how the ‘de-coupling' of the United States–China nexus has ramifications on existing international systems, the reorientation of the world economy and supply chains, and de-globalisation of maritime governance, and the third discusses why these impacts have implications for global openness. De-globalisation has its consequences and is a matter of concern because the impact changes the world into an inward-looking and highly nationalistic and a non-inclusive. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,

However, many vulnerable individuals such as illiterate or low-literate, older adults, and rural populations have limited access to health information. In this context, these individuals are more likely to have poor knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices related to COVID-19. The current study was aimed to investigate COVID-19’s awareness of the illiterate population of Pakistanis. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among illiterate Pakistanis having age ≥ 18 years through a convenient sampling approach. The study participants were interviewed, face to face, by respecting the defined precautionary measures. All data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Results: The mean age of the study participants’ (N = 394) was 37.2±9.60 years, with the majority of males (80.7%). All participants were aware of the COVID-19 outbreak and television news channels (75.1%) were the primary source of information. The mean knowledge score was 5.33±1.88. About 27% of participants had good knowledge score (score ≥ 7) followed by moderate (score 4-6) and poor (score ≤ 3) knowledge in 41.6%, and 31.5% respondents, respectively. The attitude score was 4.42±1.22 with good (score ≥ 6), average (score 4-5), and poor attitude (score ≤ 3) in 19%, 66%, and 15% participants, respectively. The average practices-related score was 12.80±3.34, with the majority of participants having inadequate practices. Conclusion: COVID-19 knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices of the illiterate population in Pakistan are unsatisfactory.

In this study, state-wise COVID-19 data, meteorological parameters and air quality index (AQI) were collected from March 13 to April 30, 2020, which encompass three movement control order (MCO) periods in the country. Overall, total infected cases were observed to be higher in MCO phase 1 and 2 and significantly reduced in MCO phase 3. Due to the variation in the spatial interval of population density and individual immunity, the relationship of these parameters to pandemic spread could not be achieved. The study infers that temperature (T) between 23 and 25 °C and relative humidity (RH) (70–80%) triggered the pandemic spread by increase in the infected cases in northern and central Peninsular Malaysia. Selangor, WP Kuala Lumpur and WP Putrajaya show significantly high infected cases and a definite trend was not observed with respect to a particular meteorological factor. It is identified that high precipitation (PPT), RH and good air quality have reduced the spread in East Malaysia. A negative correlation of T and AQI and positive correlation of RH with total infected cases were found during MCO phase 3. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that T, RH, PPT, dew point (DP) and AQI are the main controlling factors for the spread across the country apart from social distancing. Vulnerability zones were identified based on the spatial analysis of T, RH, PPT and AQI with reference to total infected cases. Based on time series analysis, it was determined that higher RH and T in Peninsular Malaysia and high amount of PPT, RH and good air quality in East Malaysia have controlled the spreading during MCO phase 3. The predominance of D614 mutant was observed prior to March and decreases at the end of March, coinciding with the fluctuation of meteorological factors and air quality. The outcome of this study gives a general awareness to the public on COVID-19 and the influence of meteorological factors. It will also help the policymakers to enhance the management plans against the pandemic spreading apart from social distancing in the next wave of COVID-19. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality; COVID-19; D614 mutant; Relative humidity; Temperature; Vulnerability",

"Social media skepticism and belief in conspiracy theories about COVID-19: the moderating role of the dark triad",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112182079&doi=10.1007%2fs12144-021-02198-1&partnerID=40&md5=00128f22df68676af5f698e06764cdf3","The prevalence of conspiracy theories about COVID-19 in the wide-open social media environment has raised considerable concerns about the adverse effects of believing such theories. The previous work showed that skepticism is negatively associated with acceptance of media content. However, this association has yet to be investigated between skepticism towards content on social media and conviction of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Furthermore, this association can be a function of social media users’ dark triad traits comprising Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy. A convenient sample of 439 Malaysian young adult social media users was recruited to complete the survey. Results showed that skepticism has a negative relationship with belief in conspiracy theories about COVID-19. However, the strength of the relationship is varied depending on respondents’ Machiavellianism and narcissism levels. The negative association between skepticism and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories is weaker for individuals with high scores on Machiavellianism. High and moderate scores on narcissism were also found to diminish the negative relationship of skepticism with COVID-19 conspiracy ideation. The results yield implications for enhancing healthy skepticism to mitigate belief in conspiracy theories promulgated on social media. Nonetheless, Machiavellianism and narcissism appeared to weaken the power of skepticism on conspiracy theories. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Conspiracy theory; COVID-19; Dark triad; Skepticism; Social media",

However, compliance with such measures is likely to be shaped by a range of factors. Here, we proposed and tested a mediation model in which rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and/or theorists mediates the relationship between rational thinking style and compliance with mandated requirements. An online, nationally representative sample of the adult population in the United Kingdom (N = 520) completed a previously validated measure of rational thinking style, as well as novel measures of rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories/theorists and compliance with mandated requirements. Intercorrelations between scores on all three measures were significant and positive. Mediation analysis indicated that rational thinking style and rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories/theorists, respectively, were directly associated with compliance, and that the mediated association was also significant. These results may have implications for practical policy aimed at promoting greater compliance with mandated requirements, including social distancing. © The Author(s) 2021.","conspiracy theories; coronavirus; COVID-19; rational thinking; social distancing",

To achieve that aim, the objectives are to: identify the critical pandemic impact (CPI) of COVID-19 on AEC organizations; compare the CPI between the different organization characteristics; and analyze the interrelationships between the CPI. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of 519 articles and in-depth interviews with 40 AEC practitioners were carried out, yielding 12 COVID-19 impacts. Then, data on the 12 impact’s criticality were collected through a survey among AEC practitioners. In total, 127 valid responses were received and analyzed using mean ranking analysis, analysis of variance and Spearman’s correlation. The findings were also compared with pandemic impacts from prior works. Findings: Five CPI exist among the 12 impacts, namely, “reduced construction productivity,” “reduced foreign investment in the construction industry,” “reduced demand on construction-related works,” “disruption in the supply chain” and “reduced number of public projects.” “Reduced foreign investment in the construction industry” and “reduced demand on construction-related works” significantly impact small-medium enterprises than large enterprises. Also, “disruption in the supply chain” and “reduced construction productivity” are recurring impacts in all countries compared. Finally, moderate relationships exist between “reduced foreign investment in the construction industry” and “reduced demand on construction-related works” and “disruption in the supply chain” and “reduced construction productivity.” Originality/value: The findings can be used to prioritize available resources in developing short-term responses for COVID-19. Also, action plans can be developed to mitigate the CPI from recurring. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AEC industry; AEC organizations; Built environment research; COVID-19; Impact; Organizational issues; Project management; Small and medium enterprises","Construction industry; International law; Productivity; Supply chains; Architectural , engineering and constructions; Construction productivity; Critical analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Foreign investment; In-depth interviews; Small medium enterprise; Systematic literature review; Investments"

Design/methodology/approach: To conduct the confirmatory analysis by testing the hypotheses formulated for this study, data have been collected from Bloomberg of all logistics firms from G-20 countries. This paper gathered the first quarter from 2010 until the last quarter of 2020 as the research sample to examine the pandemic impact on financial performance. Findings: The results show that the financial performance of logistic firms was significantly higher during 2020. Overall, the country-wise findings corroborated with the main results and the financial performance of 14 countries’ logistic firms out of 20 ones analysed has been significantly elevated, during the pandemic period. However, this paper has found out a negative financial performance of the logistics firms during the COVID-19 period in six countries (Germany, Korea, Russia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the UK), which support the second proposition. Research limitations/implications: The study’s results were important as they highlighted the role of logistics firms in offering insights to academics, practitioners, policymakers and logistic firms’ stakeholders. For future research, this paper suggests including some other variables that might influence firm performance and that have not been considered in this study, which is a limitation, and going more deeply into the logistics sector by comparing the financial performance of the sub-sectors. Practical implications: As the importance of logistics services during the pandemic period is relevant, this study may provide significant insights because the logistics firms play a crucial role by anticipating to ensure the supply of essential items such as food, medicine, then supporting for the continuity of supply chains. The view of finance impacts during the pandemic may provide insightful perspectives for logistics companies, allowing them to understand those impacts and better prepare for likely disruption events such COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: This paper is novel considering that it is unique in evaluating logistics firms’ financial performance from a global perspective, considering the context of this historical pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Financial performance; G-20 countries; Impact; Logistics firms; Quantitative",

The Fleischner Society has recommended chest X-ray (CXR) in detecting cases at high risk of disease progression, for triaging suspected patients with moderate-to-severe illness, and for eliminating false negatives in areas with high pre-test probability or limited resources. Although CXR is less sensitive than real-- time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in detecting mild COVID-19, it is nevertheless useful because of equipment portability, low cost and practicality in serial assessments of disease progression among hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the typical and relatively atypical CXR manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: The CXRs of 136 COVID-19 patients confirmed through real-time RT-PCR from March to May 2020 were reviewed. A literature search was performed using PubMed. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients had abnormal CXR whilst the others were normal. Typical CXR findings included pulmonary consolidation or ground-glass opacities in a multifocal, bilateral peripheral, or lower zone distribution, whereas atypical CXR features comprised cavitation and pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: Typical findings of COVID-19 infection in chest computed tomography studies can also be seen in CXR. The presence of atypical features associated with worse disease outcome. Recognition of these features on CXR will improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosing COVID-19 patients.

Although males are affected slightly more than females, the impact of SARS-COV-2 on male reproductive system remains unclear. This systematic review aims to provide a concise update on the effects of COVID-19 on male reproductive health, including the presence of viral RNA in semen, and the impact on semen quality, testicular histology, testicular pain and male reproductive hormones. The global health is fronting an immediate as well as impending threat from the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease (COVID-19), that inflicts more males than females. Evidence suggest that male reproductive system is susceptible to this viral infection. However, there are still several pertinent queries that remain to be fully explained regarding the mechanism in testicular SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the exact mode of its actions. Thus, the present systematic review aims to provide a concise update on the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on male reproduction. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines searching the PubMed database. Eligibility for inclusion were original human studies evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on male reproductive health. Specific outcomes required for inclusion were at least one of the following: i) seminal detection of mRNA virus, or evaluation of ii) semen analysis, iii) testicular histology or ultrasonography, iv) testicular clinical symptoms and/or v) male reproductive hormones in COVID-19-positive patients. Results: Of 553 retrieved articles, 25 met the inclusion criteria. This included studies primarily investigating the presence of viral RNA in semen (n = 12), semen quality (n = 2), testicular histology (n = 5), testicular pain (n = 2) and male reproductive hormones (n= 4). Results show little evidence for the presence of viral RNA in semen, although COVID-19 seems to affect seminal parameters, induce orchitis, and cause hypogonadism. Mortality cases suggest severe histological disruption of testicular architecture, probably due to a systemic and local reproductive tract inflammatory response and oxidative stress-induced damage. Conclusions: Clinical evaluation of the male reproductive tract, seminal parameters and reproductive hormones is recommended in patients with current or a history of COVID-19, particularly in males undergoing fertility treatment. Any long-term negative impact on male reproduction remains unexplored and an important future consideration. © 2021 The Author(s).

Leads were identified via rigorous scoring thresholds and ADMET filtering. MM-GBSA calculation was deployed to select NSP9-Lead complexes and the complexes were evaluated for their stability and protein-ligand communication via MD simulation. We identified 5 phytochemical leads for NSP9, 23 for Furin, 18 for ORF3a, and 19 for IL-6. Ochnaflavone and Licoflavone B, obtained from Lonicera japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) and Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice), respectively, were identified to have the highest potential polypharmacological properties for the aforementioned targets and may act on multiple pathways simultaneously to inhibit viral entry, replication, and disease progression. Additionally, MD simulation supports the robust stability of Ochnaflavone and Licoflavone B against NSP9 at the active sites via hydrophobic interactions, H-bonding, and H-bonding facilitated by water.

Design/Methodology/Approach: A self-administered online questionnaire was collected from 271 individual investors to examine the association between big-five personality traits and trading frequency. Demographic information and investment behaviours of investors were also included in the study. The multinomial logit regression model was used to test the research hypotheses. Research findings: Findings show that personality traits such as openness to experience and agreeableness have a significant influence on trading frequency. Demographic factors and investment behaviours such as gender, household income level, years of investment experience and type of investor all have a significant positive relationship with trading frequency. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study contributes to the current investor behaviour literature in Malaysia, which remains to be very limited, especially during a global health crisis. The study indicates that personality traits, demographic, socio-economic factors, and investment behaviours affect the trading frequency of Malaysian investors. Practitioner/Policy implication: This study offers insights for financial institutions and individual investors on the type of personality traits, demographic, socio-economic factors, and investment behaviours that drive excess trading during a global health crisis. The findings provide important contributions to avoid serious mistakes in investment analysis and trading profitable investment strategies, thus improving individual and team performance. Research limitation/Implications: Some results are not significant and may be limited due to the small sample size used in this study. Future research could recruit more retail investors to confirm the significance level of those variables.

We aimed to perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence on the effect of statins on the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, and preprint servers were searched (last updated June 3, 2021) to identify studies investigating the association between the use of statins in patients with COVID-19 and the development of severe disease and/or mortality. Random-effects model meta-analyses were performed to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The outcomes of interest were (1) all-cause mortality and (2) a composite endpoint of severe illness of COVID-19. Results: Upon systematic literature search, we identified 35 studies, of which 32 studies reported the outcome of all-cause mortality and 15 studies reported the composite endpoint of severe COVID-19 illness between statin users versus non-statin users with COVID-19. Our meta-analysis revealed that the use of statins was associated with a significantly lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.58–0.84, n = 21,127, and OR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.79, n = 115,097) and the composite endpoint of severe illness (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.73–0.88, n = 10,081) in patients with COVID-19, compared to non-use of statins, at the current sample size.

It is crucial to monitor their adverse events post vaccination. The present study focuses on cardiovascular adverse events post-COVID-19 vaccination and aims to determine adverse events with the administered vaccine. Methodology: The cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events were extracted for three broad headings (SOCs) – cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, and investigations. Descriptive statistics were reported in the form of percentage and frequency, and the disproportionality analysis was conducted. Results: For the cardiovascular system, 4863 adverse events (AEs) were reported from BNT162b2 Pfizer, 1222 AstraZeneca, Moderna, and other COVID-19 vaccines. Common adverse events observed with vaccines under study were tachycardia (16.41%), flushing (12.17%), hypertension (5.82%), hypotension (3.60%) and peripheral coldness (2.41%). Based on disproportionality analysis (IC025 values), acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and circulatory collapse were linked to the vaccines in the age group &gt;75 years. Hypertension, severe hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, and palpitations were associated across all age groups and either gender. Amongst the investiga-tions, abnormal ECG findings raised C-reactive protein, elevated D dimer, and troponin were reported in specific age groups or gender or all subjects. Conclusion: Although cardiovascular events have been reported with the COVID-19 vaccines, the causality is yet to be established because such CVS AEs are also usually associated with the general public even without intervention. Hence, people should be administered these vaccines, and sustained monitoring of these AEs should be done. © 2021 Jeet Kaur et al.","1222 AstraZeneca; Adverse events; BNT162b2; Cardiovascular adverse events; COVID-19 vaccines; Moderna",

Methods: A systematic search of articles was conducted in scientific databases, with the latest update in May 2021. This paper systematically reviewed the clinical evidence available (randomized controlled trials, compassionate use studies, and case reports) on the use of remdesivir for patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. Results: A total of eleven studies were included: four studies based on compassionate use of remdesivir, three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials, three randomized, open-label, phase III trials, and one case report. Clinical improvement and mortality rates in patients who used remdesivir varied across studies. Conclusion: Given the current evidence, there is insufficient data to confidently recommend the use of remdesivir alone for the treatment of adult hospitalized patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. However, remdesivir may be considered along with an anti-inflammatory agent in patients with pneumonia, on oxygen support, provided there is close monitoring of clinical and laboratory parameters and adverse events. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adverse events; critically ill; evidence-based medicine; remdesivir; SARS-CoV-2",

This study was carried out to assess indoor air quality in terms of particulate matter (PM) and carbon dioxide in a residential building, during COVD-19 pandemic lockdown from March 25 to April 23, 2020, Abha, Saudi Arabia. The PM concentration range for kitchen, bedroom, and hall were 40,000–81000 μg/m3 (PM0.3), 15,000–26000 μg/m3 (PM0.5), 4000–6000 μg/m3 (PM1), 1100–1500 μg/m3 (PM2.5), 160–247 μg/m3 (PM5), and 60–95 μg/m3 (PM10). The results of this study suggest that bedroom needs to be ventilated as CO2 concentration was reaching 700 ppm during sleep hours. PM concentration was exceeding 300 μg/m3 (unhealthy) for all particle sizes of PM0.3, PM0.5, PM1, and PM2.5 except for PM10 which was also above safe limits (0–50 μg/m3). Also, with influential habit (aromatic smoke), these concentrations increased 2–28 times for PM. The hazard quotient value greater than 1 revealed potential health risk to the inhabitants. Hence, future studies are needed for developing indoor air quality guidelines for residential buildings in Saudi Arabia and better planning and management of energy consumption. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon dioxide; COVID-19; Hazard quotient; Indoor air quality; Particulate matter",

Although the number of new cases reported has dropped, during the third week of May 2021, India accounted for about 45% of new cases identified globally and around 34% of deaths. As India maintains its present level of stability, a new urgent threat has emerged in the form of coronavirus-associated mucormycosis. Mucormycosis, an acute and deadly fungal infection caused by Mucorales-related fungal species, is a fungal emergency with a particularly aggressive propensity for contiguous spread, associated with a poor prognosis if not properly and immediately identified, and treated. Mucormycosis, sometimes referred to as the “black fungus,” has increased more rapidly in India during the second wave of COVID-19 than during the first wave, with at least 14,872 cases as of May 28, 2021. Uncontrolled diabetic mellitus (DM) and other immunosuppressive diseases such as neutropenia and corticosteroid treatment have traditionally been identified as risk factors for mucormycosis. Therefore, the use of glucocorticoids or high doses of glucocorticoids in mild COVID-19 cases (without hypoxemia) should be avoided. In addition, drugs that target the immune pathway, such as tocilizumab, are not recommended without clear benefits. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","black fungus; COVID-19; mucormycosis; SARS-CoV-2; steroids",

The analysis is conducted to make a comparison of the financial crime and regulatory compliance patterns before and after the Covid-19 pandemic occurred. Design/methodology/approach: This paper contextualises the impact of Covid-19 on financial crime and regulatory compliance. Moreover, this paper explores different ways of conceptualising the Covid-19 impacts in terms of financial crimes and regulatory compliance patterns based on the surveys by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte. Findings: The Covid-19 pandemic has brought both challenges and opportunities to financial crime and regulatory compliance. In the aspects of financial crime patterns, this study found a reduction in physical crime whilst on the other hand increment in cybercrime. Nevertheless, this study discovered regulatory compliance not at a satisfactory stage even before the Covid-19 pandemic, let alone during the pandemic. Practical implications: This study implies that the financial institutions must work together to combat the risks of financial crimes, not only amongst the institutions but also with the regulators. Digitalisation and robust risk management need to be improved at a massive level to beat the criminals’ high fintech skills and systems. The initiatives of fund packages from the governments to assist the companies especially the small firms need to be fully used by the companies to improve regulatory compliance. Originality/value: Whilst some studies discussed the impact of Covid-19 on the economy, there are still scarce resources on the comparative analysis on the financial crime and regulatory compliance, not to mention the before and after effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The findings suggest that countries with large tourism sectors responded more aggressively by using economic stimulus packages to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the impact of the tourism sector is moderated by the country's resilience to shocks. The study also finds that both high level of economic resilience and high level of risk quality of a country moderate the link between the tourism sector and the economic policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of the study suggest that tourism businesses in high resilient countries are better prepared to cope with the disruptive challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and thus needed less assistance from governments.

Recently, COVID-19 has become a pandemic by infecting more than 152 million people in over 216 countries and territories. The exponential increase in the number of infections has rendered traditional diagnosis techniques inefficient. Therefore, many researchers have developed several intelligent techniques, such as deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), which can assist the healthcare sector in providing quick and precise COVID-19 diagnosis. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the most recent DL and ML techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. The studies are published from December 2019 until April 2021. In general, this paper includes more than 200 studies that have been carefully selected from several publishers, such as IEEE, Springer and Elsevier. We classify the research tracks into two categories: DL and ML and present COVID-19 public datasets established and extracted from different countries. The measures used to evaluate diagnosis methods are comparatively analysed and proper discussion is provided. In conclusion, for COVID-19 diagnosing and outbreak prediction, SVM is the most widely used machine learning mechanism, and CNN is the most widely used deep learning mechanism. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are the most widely used measurements in previous studies. Finally, this review paper will guide the research community on the upcoming development of machine learning for COVID-19 and inspire their works for future development.

Some of the widely used serological testing techniques are enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). However, these tests are plagued with low sensitivity or specificity, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. We developed a serological test implementing flow-through dot-blot assay (FT-DBA) for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG detection, which provides enhanced sensitivity and specificity while being quick to perform and easy to use. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 antigens were immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane to capture human IgG, which was then detected with anti-human IgG conjugated gold nanoparticle (hIgG-AuNP). A total of 181 samples were analyzed in-house. Within which 35 were further evaluated in US FDA-approved CLIA Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 assay. The positive panel consisted of RT-qPCR positive samples from patients with both<14 days and >14 days from the onset of clinical symptoms. The negative panel contained samples collected from the pre-pandemic era dengue patients and healthy donors during the pandemic. Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of FT-DBA were evaluated against RT-qPCR positive sera. However, the overall efficacies were assessed with sera that seroconverted against either nucleocapsid (NCP) or receptor-binding domain (RBD). Results: In-house ELISA selected a total of 81 true seropositive and 100 seronegative samples. The sensitivity of samples with <14 days using FT-DBA was 94.7%, increasing to 100% for samples >14 days. The overall detection sensitivity and specificity were 98.8% and 98%, respectively, whereas the overall PPV and NPV were 99.6% and 99%. Moreover, comparative analysis between in-house ELISA assays and FT-DBA revealed clinical agreement of Cohen's Kappa value of 0.944. The FT-DBA showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% when compared with commercial CLIA kits. Conclusion: The assay can confirm past SARS-CoV-2 infection with high accuracy within 2 minutes compared to commercial CLIA or in-house ELISA. It can help track SARS-CoV-2 disease progression, population screening, and vaccination response. The ease of use of the assay without requiring any instruments while being semi-quantitative provides the avenue of its implementation in remote areas around the globe, where conventional serodiagnosis is not feasible. © 2021 Sil et al.","AuNP; COVID-19; Dot-blot immunoassay; Gold nanoparticle; Nucleocapsid; Receptor binding domain; SARS-CoV-2; Serosurveillance","coronavirus nucleocapsid protein; gold nanoparticle; immunoglobulin G; pyroxylin; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; gold; immunoglobulin G; metal nanoparticle; virus antibody; Article; chemiluminescence immunoassay; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 serological testing; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; dot hybridization; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; flow through dot blot assay; human; human cell; major clinical study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; virus nucleocapsid; adult; blood; chemistry; immunoblotting; immunology; isolation and purification; male; predictive value; procedures; seroepidemiology; virus nucleocapsid; Adult; Antibodies, Viral; Gold; Humans; Immunoblotting; Immunoglobulin G; Male; Metal Nanoparticles; Nucleocapsid; Predictive Value of Tests; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity and Specificity; Seroepidemiologic Studies"

Despite all the health and economic consequences, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on environmental health warrants the scientific community’s attention. Thus, this article examined and narratively reviewed the impact of several drastic measures taken on the macro environment and holistic planetary health. We note that the amount of pollution in the air, water, soil, and noise showed a significant decline during the pandemic. Global air quality improved due to lower anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants and atmospheric particles. Water ecosystems also demonstrated signs of recuperation in many countries. Less commercial fishing internationally resulted in the restoration of some aquatic life. Additionally, significant reduction of solid and water waste led to less soil pollution. Some places experienced cleaner beaches and ocean water while wildlife sightings in urban areas across the world occurred more often. Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown also led to a worldwide decline in noise pollution. However, the beneficial environmental effects will not be permanent as the world gradually returns to its pre-pandemic status quo. Therefore, behavioural changes such as adopting a lifestyle that reduces carbon footprint are needed to make a positive impact on the environment. In addition, world leaders should consider the national policy changes necessary to ensure continuity of as many of the positive environmental impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown as possible. Those changes would also serve to lessen the likelihood of another zoonotic calamity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","COVID-19; Environmental health; Lockdown; Pandemic; Pollution","Air quality; Behavioral research; Carbon footprint; Fisheries; Health; Hydrogeology; Noise pollution; Soil pollution; Water pollution; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric particles; Economic consequences; Environmental health; Global environmental change; Global environmental impacts; Impact on the environment; Scientific community; Sustainable development"

Globally, the disease has had a major impact on human lives, including health, economic, employment, psychological, and overall well-being. The COVID-19, besides causing respiratory, neurological, and cardiovascular diseases, has had significant impact on mental health. Major mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and stress, have risen in parallel with increasing prevalence of COVID-19. Many population groups, including children, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, and health care workers, have been affected. This review gives an overall assessment of the prevalence of COVID-19-associated psychological morbidity. In countries in the Asia-Pacific region, prevalence of depression ranged between 4.9% and 43.1%, anxiety from 7.0 to 43.0%, and stress from 3.4% to 35.7%. As COVID-19 continues to severely affect the psychosocial well-being of the population at large, countries have developed and revised policies, guidelines, and introduced new initiatives to curb mental health issues among their citizens.

The challenges of such transition included the need for enhanced infrastructure facilities, compliance to directives from regulatory bodies, providing an equivalent learning experience in the virtual learning environment (VLE) and ensuring the end user capacity to utilise the VLE created. Methods: To accomplish this task a suitable instructional design and transition model was utilised to create an integrated Moodle and Microsoft Teams platform as the VLE. The curriculum was recreated in the VLE through review of existing infrastructure and resources, deconstructing the demands of the curriculum, reconstructing the learning experiences of curriculum in VLE and innovating to improve. The end user training was also provided using the same VLE created, which ensured capacity building. Virtual Clinical Assessments (VCA) were created to ensure the completion of assessment tasks. Results: The utilisation of the ACTIONS transition model resulted in the evolution of instructional delivery from a Web Enhanced approach to a customised Web Centric approach and implementation of Virtual Clinical Assessments. Students expressed their satisfaction in the learning experience through VLE, but were anxious about their clinical training and connectivity issues. Conclusion: This transition demonstrated the need of future directions in terms of learner readiness to be more self-directed and self-determined, design thinking for transformation to a Web Centric curriculum, faculty readiness to change and develop the competency of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). © 2021 TAPS.

Therefore, this study aims to analyze the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases, epidemic spread rate, spatial pattern during the first to the second waves in the South Sumatra Province of Indonesia. This study used the geographical information system (GIS) software to map the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and epidemic spread rate. The spatial autocorrelation of the COVID-19 cases was carried out using Moran's I, while the Pearson correlation was used to examining the relationship between meteorological factors and the epidemic spread rate. Most infected areas and the direction of virus spread were predicted using wind rose analysis. The results revealed that the epidemic rapidly spread from August 1 to December 1, 2020. The highest epidemic spread rate was observed in the Palembang district and in its peripheral areas (dense urban areas), while the lowest spread rate was found in the eastern and southern parts of South Sumatra Province (remote areas). The spatial correlation characteristic of the epidemic distribution exhibited a negative correlation and random distribution. Air temperature, wind speed, and precipitation have contributed to a significant impact on the high epidemic spread rate in the second wave.

Worryingly, the trend of second or third wave of the pandemic has been noted in multiple regions despite early success of flattening the curve, such as in the case of Malaysia, post Sabah state election in September 2020. Hence, it is imperative to predict ongoing trend of COVID-19 to assist crucial policymaking in curbing the transmission. Method: Generalized logistic growth modelling (GLM) approach was adopted to make prediction of growth of cases according to each state in Malaysia. The data was obtained from official Ministry of Health Malaysia daily report, starting from 26 September 2020 until 1 January 2021. Result: Sabah, Johor, Selangor and Kuala Lumpur are predicted to exceed 10,000 cumulative cases by 2 February 2021. Nationally, the growth factor has been shown to range between 0.25 to a peak of 3.1 throughout the current Movement Control Order (MCO). The growth factor range for Sabah ranged from 1.00 to 1.25, while Selangor, the state which has the highest case, has a mean growth factor ranging from 1.22 to 1.52. The highest growth rates reported were in WP Labuan for the time periods of 22 Nov - 5 Dec 2020 with growth rates of 4.77. States with higher population densities were predicted to have higher cases of COVID-19. Conclusion: GLM is helpful to provide governments and policymakers with accurate and helpful forecasts on magnitude of epidemic and peak time.

The purpose was to investigate how virtual laboratory simulations were integrated as part of the assessments of a practical-embedded course—the aim being to evaluate students' acceptance and perception of using virtual simulation. A total of 46 students, across three different study cohorts (August 2019, March 2020, and August 2020) were evaluated different educational aspects of using virtual laboratory cases in a 4-week course within Animal Biotechnology. Overall, students regarded virtual laboratory simulation useful as part of their learning, and there is a significant increase in the level of acceptance before, during and post-COVID recovery phases. The study showed that across the different study cohorts, students perceived their confidence level in laboratory skills have been enhanced and that they can apply the skills in real-life situation. Interestingly, students (March and August 2020 cohort) who have not been exposed to the related laboratory session still perceived that the simulated activity provides clear explanation and realistic experience.

Initial success was followed by a second wave a month later, following a large religious gathering in Sri Petaling. The first two deaths due to the pandemic were reported on 17th March 2020. Malaysia decided to impose its first lockdown, known as Movement Control Order (MCO), on the following day. The second wave was successfully controlled by these strict measures within two months. Unfortunately, in July 2020, clusters of outbreaks occurred in Kedah, Sarawak and later in Sabah. In September 2020, despite mounting cases in Sabah, the 2020 State Elections went ahead. This lead to COVID-19 cases being detected among the returnees from Sabah, causing the third wave in Malaysia.

One notable aspect deserving emphasis however, is the psychological impact in children as a result of the purported surge of domestic violence (DV) in many of the countries that imposed stay-at-home requirement. The imposition of movement restriction policy led to isolation and overcrowding, made worse by loss of income in some instances, causing high levels of stress and anxiety, thereby increasing the risk of DV and child abuse particularly those already living within violent or dysfunctional families. Children exposed to DV have higher risk of developmental delay and behavioural problems, more likely to suffer from post-traumatic symptoms, depression and anxiety, reduced cognitive functioning and social competence. Additionally, these children tend to have poorer academic performance and are more likely to engage in violent or abusive relationship later in life. Health care providers need to be vigilant and actively screen and identify children or families that are affected by DV to protect their physical and mental health well-being. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.","Abuse; Children; Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; Domestic; Health; Mental; Violence; Well-being",

A scoping review framework was used to chart the evidence on nutritional recommendations to prevent COVID-19 based on the preferred method in reporting systematic review and meta-analysis extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The articles were categorised into three main groups: i) general dietary recommendations; ii) supplementation with specific micronutrients and iii) their mixtures and supplementation with traditional herbs and miscellaneous foods. A total of 60 articles met the inclusion criteria and were used in the review. This scoping review demonstrates that there is no miracle cure, food or supplement that can cure or prevent COVID-19. Currently, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine for the disease. Practicing healthy eating habits is the best nutritional recommendation during the pandemic.

The online delivery of anatomy practical classes has become a major concern among anatomy lecturers and students, especially in public institutions, as there is a lack of hands-on experience and social interaction. Nevertheless, some private medical schools have adapted well to both online lectures and practical classes, as they had been venturing towards online learning and virtual reality tools even before the pandemic commenced.

N-acetylcysteine, being a nutraceutical precursor of an important antioxidant glutathione, can perform several biological functions in mammals and microbes. It has consequently garnered a growing interest as a potential adjunctive therapy for coronavirus disease. Here, we review evidence concerning the effects of N-acetylcysteine in respiratory viral infections based on currently available in vitro, in vivo, and human clinical investigations. The repurposing of a known drug such as N-acetylcysteine may significantly hasten the deployment of a novel approach for COVID-19. Since the drug candidate has already been translated into the clinic for several decades, its established pharmacological properties and safety and side-effect profiles expedite pre-clinical and clinical assessment for the treatment of COVID-19. In vitro data have depicted that N-acetylcysteine increases antioxidant capacity, interferes with virus replication, and suppresses expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cells infected with influenza viruses or respiratory syncytial virus. Furthermore, findings from in vivo studies have displayed that, by virtue of immune modulation and anti-inflammatory mechanism, N-acetylcysteine reduces the mortality rate in influenza-infected mice animal models. The promising in vitro and in vivo results have prompted the initiation of human subject research for the treatment of COVID-19, including severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syn-drome. Albeit some evidence of benefits has been observed in clinical outcomes of patients, precision nanoparticle design of N-acetylcysteine may allow for greater therapeutic efficacy. © 2021 Wong et al.","Anti-inflammatory response; Antioxidant; Antiviral effect; Clinical translation; Coronavirus; Engineering nanoparticles; Glutathione; Immune modulating activity; N-acetylcysteine; Repurposing approved drugs; Respiratory viral diseases; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; T lymphocytes; Virus infected cells",

The study aimed to study the nature of religious coping of frontline healthcare workers seen through the perspective of gender, socio-economic status, and occupation. Methods: An online-based study was carried out among frontline healthcare workers involved in the care of COVID-19 patients (n = 200). Sociodemographic data form and the Brief Religious Coping scale were used in this study. Results: There were more female healthcare workers (60.5%) and doctors (69.5% vs. 30.5%). Healthcare workers used more positive religious coping than negative religious coping (median score: 22 vs. 9). Positive religious coping was seen more in females (median score: 23 vs. 21, P =.015). Non-doctors applied positive coping more than doctors (median score: 26 vs. 21, P <.001). There were significant differences in positive religious coping scores across income groups, with the B40 group having the highest score (median score: 24). Post hoc pairwise comparison concluded that the B40 group had significantly higher positive religious coping scores than the M40 group. Conclusion: Positive coping was utilized more among female healthcare workers, non-doctors, and the lowest socio-economic group. As prior literature has shown that positive religious coping is desirable and has superior mental health outcomes, our findings show that more effort should be channeled into enhancing positive religious coping, particu-larly among male healthcare workers, doctors, and the middle and high socio-economic group. © 2021, Cukurova University, Faculty of Medicine.

The focus was on African Independent Television (AIT), a privately owned TV, and Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), a government-owned TV. We also interviewed (n = 30) participants to understand their view on media coverage of the pandemic. We found that the TV stations paid adequate attention to the issues of COVID-19. However, the private media allocated more prominence to the coverage of COVID-19. By implication, the private media had more COVID-19 stories telecasted on its headline which also appeared as the first headline in many cases. Furthermore, they had more stories that were aired 61 seconds and above. The findings also showed that the government media outlet cited more of government officials while the private media dueled more on the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The private media had more negative tone stories, and most of its stories used visual and motion footages. Overall, our findings suggest that media ownership and politics play a large role in the coverage of COVID-19 in Nigeria.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a library-based study that uses qualitative method to explore the impact of COVID-19 on Hajj and Umrah. Thus, provisions of Quran and hadith on Hajj and Umrah were examined as primary data for the research to establish the importance of the rituals in Islam. Guidelines set by Hajj regulators and instruments enabling them in that behalf were examined likewise. In addition, content analyses were made of relevant secondary data from published sources including articles, books, newspapers and web resources that embody scholarly, scientific and religious views on the issue being studied. Findings: It is realised that in the first year of the pandemic, while Umrah is entirely suspended, Hajj was scaled back and performed by 10,000 people altogether, a tiny segment of the over two and half million that partook in the ritual previously. Hajj and Umrah have been greatly inhibited and jeopardised by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in religious, social, economic, psychological effects on the eligible but affected Muslims and Muslims countries. Along these lines, recommendations were accordingly proffered on the way forward to better Hajj and Umrah management. Originality/value: It is anticipated that the findings of the research would assist policy makers to comprehend the impact of the pandemic on Hajj and Umrah to ensure that the policies they make in this regard would adequately cover every aspect affecting the stakeholders which is deliberated in this research. It is also expected that the recommendations provided in this paper will assist stakeholders of Hajj and Umrah to grasp the importance of taking precautions for any crisis similar to COVID-19 when it happens. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Hajj; Pandemic; Religious mass gatherings; Umrah",

The Indonesian government has been confronted with issues such as health services, case detection, the financial capacity of the state, and the decline of economic activity. This study aimed to examine the policies and social advantages of ""the new normal""as a case study of handling the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. This was a qualitative study using primary and secondary data. The study showed that the government's responses were ineffective and insufficient for preparing contingency measures. Poor coordination between central and regional governments has also been observed as a public concern. The central government decided to implement a large-scale social distancing policy instead of imposing a total lockdown due to its massive financial burden on the government. While making the policies, the central government was concerned more with political and economic considerations and prohibited regional governments from imposing local lockdown policies, unless permitted by the central government. This situation allegedly resulted in substandard protection of the people from the pandemic. The central government's budgeting policy also failed to put more emphasis on the public health services because the budget for the health sector was lower than the budget for economic recovery and social assistance. However, notwithstanding the government's unproductive policies in handling the pandemic, Indonesian people have mutual assistance culture as a social advantage. Through such social capital, people were driven to help each other, especially regarding social and economic assistance to the affected people. Contrarily, mutual awareness may have driven people to refrain from doing activities in public areas and to stay at home to stop the spread of COVID-19. It boosted the social endurance of the people in dealing with the pandemic toward a new normal. © Common Ground Research Networks, Rusman Ghazali, TB Massa Djafar, Sity Daud, All Rights Reserved.","Capitalists; Economic Impact; Government; Handling the COVID-19; Mutual Assistance; New Normal; Pandemic; People; Policies; Public Health; Social Advantages; Social Impact; World Health Organization",

In so doing, we pose some central questions oriented to understand the sense of new normality, where the social distancing marks human relations. We coin the term trivialisation of death to discuss the ideological dispositions revolving around the domestication of death. In parallel, a new debate around the idea of the tourist-gaze is amounted in the section to follow. In the pre-pandemic world, tourists were valorised as ambassadors of the civilised order, but now they appear to be demonised as potential carriers of a lethal decease, if not potential terrorists who lurk to attack anytime. To some extent, COVID19 -far from being a foundational event- reaffirms a logic that starts with 9/11 and the so-called War on Terror.

Therefore, this paper aims to examine various firms' organizational social responses to COVID-19 as an external crisis, particularly in terms of the way organizations use their resources to address social problems and the real intention behind these, and the changing organizational drivers influencing such behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: The authors explore the initiatives of seven organizations from three different industries in several countries and their actions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A case study approach was taken to collect data and reach a conclusion. A combination of interviews, online communication using semi-structured questionnaires and documentary information available in the public domain was used to collect data and analyze and triangulate the events. Findings: Similar internal resources and capacities of the seven organizations resulted in similar responses as they launched proactive initiatives to prepare sanitizers. This research indicates that these organizations pursued other goals besides economic one. When society needed help, these organizations responded quickly, using and reorganizing their resources to assist communities in need. Different organizations from different sectors all behaved in a similar manner, making genuine contributions to the pandemic as each was uniquely capable of doing. These organizations also used their unique capabilities to offer their resources to local communities and governments. Originality/value: During the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts by corporate entities to facilitate social reform and recovery have been seen around the globe. The findings could help in understanding the responses of organizations engaging in socially responsible behaviors to overcome external crises. This paper also identifies changing organizational values and their possible impact on society and overall industry philanthropy practices in the future. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; COVID-19; Crisis; Philanthropy",

With the preventive measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, all face-to-face teaching and learning are converted to e-learning. The COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of e-learning may influence these students’ mental conditions. This study aimed to determine the association of factors with mental health status (depression, anxiety and stress) among university students in Malaysia. Study participants were tertiary education students from both the private and public universities in Malaysia. Participants were recruited via university emails and social media. The survey was administered via the online REDCap platform, from April to June 2020, during the movement control order period in the country. The questionnaire captured data on socio-demographic characteristics, academic information, implementation of e-learning, perception towards e-learning and COVID-19; as well as DASS 21 to screen for depression, anxiety and stress. The levels of stress, anxiety and depression were 56.5% (95% CI: 50.7%, 62.1%), 51.3% (95% CI: 45.6%, 57.0%) and 29.4% (95% CI: 24.3%, 34.8%) respectively. Most participants had good perception towards e-learning but negative perception on COVID-19. From the multivariate analysis, participants with positive perception on COVID-19 were protective towards stress (aOR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.99), anxiety (aOR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90, 0.98) and depression (aOR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.99). Older students were 14% (aOR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.94) and 11% (aOR: 0.89: 95% CI: 0.80, 0.99) less likely for anxiety and depression, respectively. Students originated from the Malay ethnicity had higher odds (aOR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.56) for depression. These findings demonstrated that the mental status of university students was greatly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Albeit almost all countries shut down their borders to prevent rapid spread of the virus. However, the number of cases continues to increase in developing countries at a faster rate due to community and cluster transmission. The severity of this epidemic made it a pandemic as it progressed to over 200 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO), governments, and national disease control and prevention units worked together to break the chain and are working to contain the catastrophic impact of COVID-19. They formulated and recommended various guidelines like social distancing, frequent hand washing, and social distancing to inhibit the spread of the virus. WHO also advised that the general population and medical personnel wear face masks, face shields, gloves, and aprons? As a result, this waste category has substantially increased and, if not disposed of properly, may cause the infection or help to catalyze COVID-19. In developing countries, poor solid waste management may aggravate chances of spreading COVID-19. Sustainable solid waste management is a critical parameter for the health, wellbeing, and development of society. The measures adopted to contain and restrict the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and minimize the degrees of freedom in commercial events affected solid waste management considerably. During this crucial time, the services provided by waste management agencies and personnel are invaluable and these services help to prevent the improper disposal of waste, which may lead to health risks due to the spread of COVID. COVID-19 is a new and novel virus and experts are learning more about it overtime and with evolving science. This review paper provides insight into different types of solid wastes generated during the pandemic, their consequences, and the implication of various policies. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","disposal; face masks; medical waste; policies; solid waste management",

The PLS-SEM results concluded that the content delivery has been the most significant construct to impact both self-efficacy and overall learning. The self-efficacy partially mediates the support and equity relationship with the overall learning. The student with greater self-efficacy will have better overall learning from this e-synchronous teaching methodology. However, content delivery has a stronger role in impacting the overall learning even if there is absence of self-efficacy, thus concluding no mediation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Educational research; Online education; Student centered learning; Synchronous communication; Teacher effectiveness",

Greater effects of news-find-me perception and information overload were found on fake news sharing behaviour as compared to trust in online information, status seeking, self-expression and information sharing. Theoretically, our study enriches the current literature by focusing on the affordances of social media and the abundance of online information in predicting fake news sharing behaviour among social media users, especially in Nigeria. Practically, we suggest intervention strategies which nudge people to be sceptical of the information they come across on social media. © The Author(s) 2021.","COVID-19; fake news; fake news sharing; Nigeria; social media users","deception; human; pandemic; social media; COVID-19; Deception; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media"

All small molecules co-crystallized with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank were used as inputs. Fragments sitting in the binding pocket (87) were grouped into eight geographical types. They were interactively coupled using various synthetically reasonable linkers to generate larger molecules with divalent binding modes taking advantage of two different fragments' interactions. In total, 1,251 compounds were proposed, and 7,158 stereoisomers were screened using Glide (standard precision and extra precision), AutoDock Vina, and Prime MMGBSA. The top 22 hits having conformations approaching the linear combination of their constituent fragments were selected for MD simulation on Desmond.

This article presents a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to ascertain if methylprednisolone can be recommended for use in patients with COVID-19 to prevent deaths. Methods: Systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and preprint servers until 13 April 2021. The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The random-effects model for the meta-analysis was utilized to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Five RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR for all-cause mortality was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.29 − 1.43, n = 652) comparing methylprednisolone with the control, indicating no mortality benefits. A similar finding was noted with a sub-group analysis including four trials that used low-dose methylprednisolone. However, the only trial that administered high dose methylprednisolone indicated a statistically significant mortality benefit (OR 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02–0.42). Conclusions: In determining equipotent doses for an acute short-course pulse therapy of corticosteroids, the biological half-life of steroids should also be accounted for besides the potency factor. A short duration (3–5 days) pulse therapy of high-dose methylprednisolone can be a promising alternative to the low-dose dexamethasone therapy in severely ill patients with COVID-19 to prevent deaths. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Coronavirus; corticosteroids; deaths; dexamethasone; methylprednisolone; pandemic; SARS-CoV-2",

"Efficient Classification of COVID-19 CT Scans By Using Q-transform Model For feature Extraction",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109153149&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj-cs.553&partnerID=40&md5=68e1e601eb6edb01422f6d3664d2564e","The exponential growth in computer technology throughout the past two decades has facilitated the development of advanced image analysis techniques which aid the field of medical imaging. CT is a widely used medical screening method used to obtain high resolution images of the human body. CT has been proven useful in the screening of the virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic by allowing physicians to rule out suspected infections based on the appearance of the lungs from the CT scan. Based on this, we hereby propose an intelligent yet efficient CT scan-based COVID-19 classification algorithm that is able to discriminate negative from positive cases by evaluating the appearance of lungs. The algorithm is comprised of four main steps: preprocessing, features extraction, features reduction, and classification. In preprocessing, we employ the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to adjust the contrast of the image to enhance the details of the input image. We then apply the q-transform method to extract features from the CT scan. This method measures the grey level intensity of the pixels which reflects the features of the image. In the feature reduction step, we measure the mean, skewness and standard deviation to reduce overhead and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, “k-nearest neighbor”, “decision tree”, and “support vector machine” are used as classifiers to classify the cases. The experimental results show accuracy rates of 98%, 98%, and 98.25% for each of the classifiers, respectively. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method is efficient, accurate, and flexible. Overall, we are confident that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving a high classification accuracy under different scenarios, which makes it suitable for implementation in real-world applications.

In this context, researchers are urged and encouraged to research in various fields, to stop the spread of this deadly virus. To this end, we propose a systematic review that addresses the techniques and methods of artificial intelligence in diagnosing COVID-19 disease. The main aim of the current systematic review was to highlight the gaps and challenges within the academic literature of the disease COVID-19, which included the characteristics of the data, machine learning algorithms applied to the diagnosis of COVID-19, and using natural language processing (NLP)to reveal clinical data for COVID-19 disease.Seven reliable databases were used, namely Web of Science, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, PubMed, springer and google scholar, to obtain studies related to the specific topic many filtering and surveying stages were conducted consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, to screen the acquired 1115 papers.We identified the bottleneck in explaining data as one of the major barriers to machine learning and NLP approaches. Supervised machine learning has been explored as an active method for diagnosing COVID-19 disease. Future studies in this area will benefit from alternatives like increasing the volume of data, using intelligence swarms to obtain accurate features, and using unsupervised learning that does not require explanatory data. Thus, this research supported us to get a more practical comprehension of the gaps and provide possible solutions for filling these gaps. © 2021.

Through a confirmatory factor analysis, the student understanding scale was validated in three dimensions: technology acceptance, teaching approach and student readiness in the practice of Open and Distance Learning (ODL). The article also analysed the relationship between student understanding and the three variables. A total of 370 respondents had been selected using the purposive sampling method using SPSS analysis. The result showed that there is a weak relationship between the teaching approach and student understanding with the correlation of 0.355. It is followed by the moderate relationship between teaching approach and student understanding with the correlation of 0.613. Meanwhile, student readiness and student understanding have been identified as a very strong relationship with the correlations of 0.743. The findings also found that student readiness has the highest mean as compared to other factors. This result specified that the students of UiTM Melaka are not fully prepared mentally and physically for an inclusive ODL approach.

It examines the factors that support and/or impede peoples' access and response towards COVID-19 vaccination in Pakistan. The study uses a literature synthesis approach to examine and analyze the situation of the COVID-19 vaccination in Pakistan. The research results show “hesitancy” and “inequality” as two fundamental challenges that hinder the successful delivery of COVID-19 vaccination in Pakistan. People are reluctant to use vaccines due to conspiracy theories and religious beliefs. However, inequality, especially unequal accessibility to all social groups appears to be a more significant barrier to getting a vaccine. We argue that there is a need to mobilize community influence, social media, and mass media campaigns for public education on vaccination programs along with the engagement of religious leaders to endorse the vaccination for the masses. The area of this study is underdeveloped; thereby, future studies are recommended to investigate the possible way for equitable distribution of vaccines in multiple regions. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","COVID-19; hesitancy; inequality; Pakistan; vaccine",

An online cross-sectional survey was conducted on Pakistani citizens via the snowball sampling technique. A total of 377 respondents (256 males and 121 females) participated in this study from August to October 2020. Adapted scales were validated using confirmatory factor analysis, and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was applied to the data to test the hypothesised model. The study's findings showed a negative relationship between fear of COVID-19 and QOL. Likewise, a reciprocal relationship was found between situational depression and quality of life. The results indicate that fear of COVID-19 and situational depression during the pandemic have affected the lives of Pakistani citizens. The findings are particularly relevant for improving the QOL by limiting the information received from media and social networks. There is a need to control these mediums and promote community-based interventions to provide accurate knowledge regarding COVID-19. Fear of COVID-19 and situational depression may be reduced in this way. Based on the current findings, psychotherapy and counselling programmes must be planned to minimise the adverse effects of fear of COVID-19 and depression on the QOL of citizens due to the ongoing progression of the pandemic. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","depression; fear of COVID-19; Pakistani citizens; quality of life",

Methods: An online survey was sent to practicing ophthalmologists around the world through email, Whatsapp™ ListServ17.0™ (for pediatric ophthalmologists), WeChat™ (China) and ophthalmology associations (Indonesia, Philippines, Ireland). All queries were collected and categorized. Responses to the queries were given according to the recommendations by the Ophthalmology association. Practices ability to deal with the COVID were also classified according to country and type of access to PPE. Statistical analyses of the association between these data and queries, where appropriate were carried out. Results: One thousand nine hundred sixteen ophthalmologists were invited to participate in a survey between April 10th and April 30th, 2020 of which 1207 responded, which is a response rate of approximately 63%. The majority of respondents were from India, Indonesia, China, Singapore and the USA. Our study indicates a precipitous drop in surgical procedures with 46% (n = 538) ophthalmologists ceased to operate on their patients and almost 40% (n = 486) were doing less than 25% of their original number of surgeries. The intent to resume elective surgeries was a consideration in 41% (n = 495) after an evaluation of the situation and in consultation with professional bodies. More than 2/3 of the respondents (n = 703) made it a priority to use and mandate their patients to practice physical distancing, wearing masks, and hand dis-infection for protection to limit the spread of infection. Conclusion: This global survey provides a real-world assessment of diverse practices that were in various forms of “shut down mode” and circumstances with varying capabilities to deal with COVID. It is unprecedented that the collective wisdom for a curtailment of practice has had an enormous immediate and far reaching implications on the livelihoods of ophthalmologists, their staff, and their families.

Such information about zakat in the virtual world creates unstructured data, which contains important information and knowledge. This paper aims to discover knowledge related to zakat administration during the pandemic from the information in a virtual environment. Furthermore, the discussion is contextualised to the socio-economic debates. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative study operated via text mining to discover knowledge of zakat administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Board of Zakat Republic of Indonesia (BAZNAS RI) is selected for a single case study. This paper samples BAZNAS RI’s situation report on COVID-19 from its virtual website. The data consists of 40 digital pages containing 19,812 characters, 3,004 words and 3,003 white spaces. The text mining analytical steps are performed via RStudio. The following R packages, networkD3, igraph, ggraph and ggplot2 are used to run the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling. Findings: The machine learning analysis via RStudio results in the 16 topics associated with the 3 primary topics (i.e. Education, Sadaqah and Health Services). The topic modelling discovers knowledge about BAZNAS RI’s assistance for COVID-19 relief, which may help the readers understand zakat administration in times of the pandemic from BAZNAS RI’s virtual website. This finding may draw the theory of socio-economic zakat, which explains that zakat as a religious obligation plays a critical role in shaping a Muslim community's social and economic processes, notably during the unprecedented times of COVID-19. Research limitations/implications: This study uses data from a single zakat institution. Thus, the generalisation of the finding is limited to the sampled institution. Practical implications: This research is both theoretically and practically important for academics and industry professionals. This paper contributes to the novelty in performing text mining via R in gaining knowledge about the recent zakat administration from a virtual website. The finding of this study (i.e. the topic modelling) is practically essential for zakat stakeholders to understand the contribution of zakat in managing the COVID-19 impacts. Social implications: This work derives a theory of “socio-economic zakat” that explains the importance of a zakat institution in activating zakat for managing socio-economic issues during the pandemic. Thus, paying zakat to an authorised institution may actualise more maslahah (public interest) compared to paying it directly to the asnaf (zakat beneficiaries) without any measurement Originality/value: This study is among the pioneers in gaining knowledge from Indonesia’s zakat management during the COVID-19 outbreak via text mining.

Pandemic has also induced changes in our perceptions of safety in public spaces, necessitating the adoption of social distancing and more widespread use of online platforms for purchasing and communication. While the pandemic might be a catalyst for the adoption of contactless technologies, some restaurateurs remain hesitant to invest in service robots because they are not convinced of the return on investment and the potential value service robots can deliver to their customers. Therefore, this study aims to explore customer value perceptions of service robots and their impact on customers’ attitudes and behaviors toward robotic restaurants. Findings yielded by a survey of 445 potential diners in Taiwan show that customers’ willingness to use and to pay more for robotic restaurants are determined by their attitudes toward robots, which are influenced by functional, conditional, epistemic, emotional, co-creation, and social values. Our survey results also reveal that the importance of conditional value is amplified by crisis-specific antecedents, namely the need for physical distancing and mysophobia. These findings have implications for restaurant pricing policies and can be considered by restaurant managers when formulating strategies aimed at sustaining their business in these challenging times. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","COVID-19; customer perceived value; mysophobia; physical distancing; service robots; willingness to pay more",

The present study investigates the vulnerable groups’ reaction from informal sectors to the execution of the self-isolation policy of COVID-19 in Semarang City, Indonesia. This study is designed using a qualitative method with an ethnography approach. Using the binary opposition thinking pattern pioneered by Levi-Strauss, this study conducts the interview process with 25 informants in Semarang City. The data analysed using the response pattern of informants. We use the taxonomy analysis and finds three levels of vulnerability group; (a) jobs lost, (b) income decreased, and (c) delayed salary. The result of the analysis found that the group that obeys self-isolation is a rational thinking model. They stay at home, do not go to work, and no income. Also, the group who ignored self-isolation is a non-rational thinking model. They work, as usual, get their salaries, and believe that Covid-19 is a disaster; they pray for their safety to God. In conclusion, COVID 19 brings an economic impact on vulnerable groups in the forms of postponing, declining, and missing income. Even its circumstances are worse when self-isolation is forced. Thus, this study suggests that the government needs to assist vulnerable groups by focusing on strategic policies, such as strategies for survival, providing access to basic needs, and livelihood plans by providing access to improve livelihoods sustainably. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

The disappearance of antibodies, absence of humoral immunity activation, and sporadic reinfection cases emphasize the importance of longitudinal antibody dynamics against variable structural antigens. Methods: In this study, twenty-five healthy subjects working in a SARS-COV-2 serodiag-nostic assay development project were enrolled, and their sign and symptoms were followed up to six months. Three subjects showed COVID-19-like symptoms, and three subjects’ antibody dynamics were followed over 120 days by analyzing 516 samples. We have developed 12 different types of in-house ELISAs to observe the kinetics of IgG, IgM, and IgA against four SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely nucleocapsid, RBD, S1, and whole spike (S1 +S2). For the development of these assays, 30–104 pre-pandemic samples were taken as negative controls and 83 RT-qPCR positive samples as positive ones. Results: All three subjects presented COVID-19-like symptoms twice, with mild symptoms in the first episode were severe in the second, and RT-qPCR confirmed the latter. The initial episode did not culminate with any significant antibody development, while a multifold increase in IgG antibodies characterized the second episode. Interestingly, IgG antibody development concurrent with IgM and IgA and persisted, whereas the latter two weans off rather quickly if appeared. Conclusion: Antibody kinetics observed in this study can provide a pathway to the successful development of sero-diagnostics and epidemiologists to predict the fate of vaccination currently in place. © 2021 Jamiruddin et al.","Antibody dynamics; COVID-19; Reinfection; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination",

In Malaysia, the list of gazetted sites by the government for the COVID quarantine stations were being retrieved in March 2020 to facilitate Ministry of Health in coping with the sporadic diseases. To achieve lower production cost and rapid execution of disaster shelter for the pandemic, possible open plan spaces in institutional building will be identified to perform temporary medical shelter. Resuscitation area, wards, pharmacy, x-ray room, staff room and meeting rooms are among the required spaces in determining the medical layout planning of the particular quarantine station. A descriptive and qualitative design was being used based on the literature review and case studies in order to get the information and to identify clear demarcation of circulation and movement in the quarantine station. Ultimately, foreseeing holistic changes and novel solutions in construction industry in Malaysia, this result will contribute to further assist authorities to gazette other institutional hall as transitional stay which will be become the norms nowadays. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office","adaptive reuse; Design; quarantine station",

In Indonesia, the B.1.1.7 cases have been found in several provinces since January 2021, although they are still in a lower number than the old variant of COVID-19. Therefore, this study aims to create a forecast analysis regarding the occasions of COVID-19 and B.1.1.7 cases based on data from the 1st January to 18th March 2021, and also analyze the association between meteorological factors with B.1.1.7 incidences in three different provinces of Indonesia such as the West Java, South Sumatra and East Kalimantan. Methods: We used the Autoregressive Moving Average Models (ARIMA) to forecast the number of cases in the upcoming 14 days and the Spearman correlation analysis to analyze the relationship between B.1.1.7 cases and meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, sunshine, and wind speed. Results: The results of the study showed the fitted ARIMA models forecasted there was an increase in the daily cases in three provinces. The total cases in three provinces would increase by 36% (West Java), 13.5% (South Sumatra), and 30% (East Kalimantan) as compared with actual cases until the end of 14 days later. The temperature, rainfall and sunshine factors were the main contributors for B.1.1.7 cases with each correlation coefficients; r = −0.230; p < 0.05, r = 0.211; p < 0.05 and r = −0.418; p < 0.01, respectively.

The first step to mitigate and control its spread is to identify and isolate the infected people. But, because of the lack of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-CPR) tests, it is important to discover suspected COVID- 19 cases as early as possible, such as by scan analysis and chest X-ray by radiologists. However, chest X-ray analysis is relatively time-consuming since it requires more than 15 minutes per case. In this paper, an automated novel detection model of COVID-19 cases is proposed to perform real-time detection of COVID-19 cases. The proposed model consists of three main stages: Image segmentation using Harris Hawks optimizer, synthetic image augmentation using an enhanced Wasserstein And Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network, and image classification using Conventional Neural Network. Raw chest X-ray images datasets are used to train and test the proposed model. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is very efficient in the automatic detection of COVID-19 positive cases. It achieved 99.4% accuracy, 99.15% precision, 99.35% recall, 99.25% F-measure, and 98.5% specificity. © 2021 CRL Publishing.

Thus, various technologies that allow for the fast detection of COVID-19 infections with high accuracy can offer healthcare professionals much-needed help. This study is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest X-rays (CXRs). The dataset used in the experiments consists of 1200 CXR images from individuals with COVID-19, 1345 CXR images from individuals with viral pneumonia, and 1341 CXR images from healthy individuals. In this paper, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and precise identification of COVID-19 from CXR images has been explored based on different pretrained deep learning algorithms and fine-tuned to maximise detection accuracy to identify the best algorithms. The results showed that deep learning with X-ray imaging is useful in collecting critical biological markers associated with COVID-19 infections. VGG16 and MobileNet obtained the highest accuracy of 98.28%. However, VGG16 outperformed all other models in COVID-19 detection with an accuracy, F1 score, precision, specificity, and sensitivity of 98.72%, 97.59%, 96.43%, 98.70%, and 98.78%, respectively. The outstanding performance of these pretrained models can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. However, a larger dataset of COVID-19 X-ray images is required for a more accurate and reliable identification of COVID-19 infections when using deep transfer learning.

From flight cancellations to the closure of hospitality establishments, COVID-19 has greatly transformed the industry. Whilst a crisis such as a pandemic is not new in tourism and hospitality, the unique characteristics of COVID-19 have altered the risk perceptions associated with destinations. To date, the tourism risk literature has predominantly focused on typology of risks, at the expense of examining the process of how risk perceptions are formed. Following a social constructivist epistemological position, this conceptual paper proposes an integrative model that unpacks the underlying psychological process of risk perceptions and demonstrates how the framing process influences the safety perceptions and moulds the travel image of a destination in the COVID-19 context.

It is not hyperbole to state that COVID-19 has affected and infected almost everyone in society and the global community in different ways. However, many parts of the world seem to be improving. Individuals, organisations, and governments are trying to work through some effective strategies. The present study investigates the influence of fluctuation in the oil prices, COVID-19, and daily news-based index on Electronic Arts Inc's stock prices by applying a novel approach entitled Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) during 2019–2020. This approach is quite meaningful as it incorporates various quantiles with a comprehensive explanation of overall dependence among stated variables ignored by the traditional models like quantile regression, OLS, ARDL, etc. The study outcomes through QARDL reveal that the error correction coefficient is significant in various quantiles while confirming the long-run linkage among oil price, COVID-19, and EPU. More specifically, the study outcomes confirm a positive linkage (in all the quantiles) between COVID-19 and stock prices of Electronic Arts Inc, whereas a negative connection (for 0.20th to 0.95th quantiles) between oil prices and SPI. Furthermore, the Granger causality findings indicate the bidirectional causality between SPI and OIL and between SPI and EPU.

Methods: A total of 266 healthcare workers working in a medical college in Nepal were studied using a questionnaire consisting of three sections: demographics, experiences and perception of COVID-19, and COVID-19 vaccine safety. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 26. The total perception score was calculated by noting respondent’s agree- ment with a set of eleven statements using a Likert-type scale. Non-parametric tests (Mann- Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis) were used for analysis (p<0.05). Results: Altogether, 13.9% of respondents had been diagnosed COVID-19 positive prior to the survey. Many considered themselves to be at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Only over one third (38.3%) were willing to be vaccinated. The most common reason for refusal/hesitancy was concern about vaccine safety. The median (interquartile range) total perception score was 36 (4) (maximum possible score=55). The score was significantly higher among those who had been diagnosed COVID positive, those who perceived the pandemic as being moderate or severe and among those willing to be vaccinated Conclusion: Addressing doubts related to vaccine safety and providing more data on the safety of vaccine may be helpful in overcoming hesitancy. © 2021 Paudel et al.","Knowledge score; Nonparametric tests; Questionnaire; Staff","adult; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; data analysis; demography; drug safety; female; health care personnel; human; infection risk; Likert scale; male; medical school; middle aged; Nepal; nonparametric test; pandemic; personal experience; questionnaire; risk perception; scoring system; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy"

Many COVID-19 contraction experiments require comprehensive clinical procedures at medical facilities. Clinical studies help to make a correct diagnosis of COVID-19, where the disease has already spread to the organs in most cases. Prompt and early diagnosis is indispensable for providing patients with the possibility of early clinical diagnosis and slowing down the disease spread. Therefore, clinical investigations in patients with COVID-19 have revealed distinct patterns of breathing relative to other diseases such as flu and cold, which are worth investigating. Current supervised Machine Learning (ML) based techniques mostly investigate clinical reports such as X-Rays and Computerized Tomography (CT) for disease detection. This strategy relies on a larger clinical dataset and does not focus on early symptom identification. Towards this end, an innovative hybrid unsupervised ML technique is introduced to uncover the probability of COVID-19 occurrence based on the breathing patterns and commonly reported symptoms, fever, and cough. Specifically, various metrics, including body temperature, breathing and cough patterns, and physical activity, were considered in this study. Finally, a lightweight ML algorithm based on the K-Means and Isolation Forest technique was implemented on relatively small data including 40 individuals. The proposed technique shows an outlier detection with an accuracy of 89%, on average. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

These losses have also affected the reliability of communication and employees’ performance, hence destabilizing the electric power system. This article aims at achieving two objectives. First, analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the communication of performance (human error and human factors) and energy management in electricity production. Second, to develop a conceptual framework model to alleviate effects of the pandemic on the power sector and then improve energy management and human performance. This paper involves investigating the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global production of electricity in the first quarters of 2019 and 2020. A conceptual model was developed based on a case study. Additionally, to ensure reliability, a variable, namely COVID-19, was used as a moderator to examine the effects of the independent and dependent variables. The results show that scores for the internet of things (IoT) with awareness and communication (A&C) and workplace environment management were high with Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.87 for the IoT and 0.89 for A&C. These numbers are important indicators of factors that could affect performance and energy management and should not be overlooked by the top management. The results also indicate that the pandemic has had a direct effect on the electricity production sector, and the conceptual framework model revealed that COVID-19, as a moderator, has a direct effect on the variables that significantly affect the improvement of both energy management and employee performance. The case study’s results confirm the poor performance in power plant maintenance and operation, in which human error would increase especially in Iraqi power plants that have not yet adopted any internationally recognized standards for energy management. This paper contributes to the literature studying COVID-19’s impact on the electricity sector in two ways: first, by developing a model to assist the electricity production sector mitigating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and second, by providing a detailed investigation into the pandemic’s impact on the electricity sector’s global production. The findings are hoped to assist researchers and research centers in understanding the general and specific framework to manage the pandemic’s effects on electricity production. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

We compared comorbidities, clinical features and other predictive factors between COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission for intubation/mechanical ventilation and all other COVID-19 cases in Selangor, Malaysia. Method: Field data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Selangor, Malaysia, up to 13 April 2020 were used, comprising socio-demographic characteristics, comorbidities and presenting symptoms of COVID-19 cases. ICU admission was determined from medical records. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with ICU admission requiring intubation/mechanical ventilation among COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 1287 COVID-19-positive cases were included for analysis. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (15.5%) and diabetes (11.0%). More than one third of cases presented with fever (43.8%) or cough (37.1%). Of the 25 cases that required intubation/mechanical ventilation, 68.0% had hypertension, 88.0% had fever, 40.0% had dyspnoea and 44.0% were lethargic. Multivariate regression showed that cases that required intubation/mechanical ventilation had significantly higher odds of being older (aged 360 years) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.9] and having hypertension (aOR = 5.7), fever (aOR = 9.8), dyspnoea (aOR = 9.6) or lethargy (aOR = 7.9) than cases that did not require intubation/mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: The COVID-19 cases in Selangor, Malaysia requiring intubation/mechanical ventilation were significantly older, with a higher proportion of hypertension and symptoms of fever, dyspnoea and lethargy. These risk factors have been reported previously for severe COVID-19 cases, and highlight the role that ageing and underlying comorbidities play in severe outcomes to respiratory disease.

This pandemic situation has in turn prompted the government to introduce policies to restart and improve economic activity and stock market performance. Hence, does the government’s interference in attempting to control the outbreak of COVID-19 disease, play an important part in affecting the level of economic activity and stock market performance? To resolve this doubt, the impact of government policy responses to COVID-19 in the case of Malaysia was investigated. The sample period of the study was from 28 January 2020 till 29 May 2020, amounting to a total of 84 observations. The findings reveal that the responses taken by the government, such as staying at home requirements, closure of workplaces and debt or contract relief for households, significantly affected both economic activity and stock market performance in the country.

Despite gaining the researcher’s attention, the impact of Covid-19 on trade performances are still relatively understudied. Hence, this study aims to analyse the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak on the bilateral sectoral export for Malaysia. This study employs Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) regressions to analyse the sectoral impact in gravity models. The findings provide new perspectives on the varying impacts of the current pandemic outbreak on sectoral trade performances. The dummy variables that represent the existence of Covid-19 have significantly reduced bilateral exports for 11 sectors while increased the exports for seven sectors. Meanwhile, the severity of the Covid-19 outbreak (measured by the number of new cases and death cases) in Malaysia has negative impacts on 14 sectors. The reason for this is that when the current pandemic outbreak in Malaysia is more severe, the government has to enforce stricter movement controls that affect productions and reduce exports. On the other hand, the severity of the Covid-19 outbreak in trading partners has positive impacts on the export for 13 sectors in Malaysia. This is because the more severe pandemic outbreak in trading nations causes lower production capacities and thus higher dependence on imported goods. Differences between the impact of Covid-19 existence and severity by sectors should serve as a red flag for Malaysia’s policymakers to take immediate actions to minimise the impact of the ongoing pandemic outbreak and maximise gains from sectors that have higher demand post Covid-19. The net negative impact on the export performance further reiterates the need for government intervention policies to ensure domestic firms can withstand the current tide, which then minimises the social and economic impacts and helps the economy to recover. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

More than 50% of the buy signals emitted by (5,60,0.01) were found linked with positive returns in the next trading day during the MCO and CMCO sub-period respectively. Conversely, 41.28% and 34.78% of the sell signals emitted by (5,50,0.01) during the respective MCO and CMCO sub-period were linked with negative returns.

Access to credit or financing, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, is vital for micro-entrepreneurs in climbing the socio-economic ladder that will contemporaneously increase their household income. In Malaysia, most of the MEs can hardly access financing from formal financial institutions due to poor credit rating, having zero to little collateral, income instability, small loan amounts, and high transaction costs. Alternatively, MEs approach Islamic microfinance institutions for their financing solution. Therefore, this study intends to investigate how far the utilization of Islamic microfinancing by MEs could enhance their quality of life. One hundred seven (107) usable questionnaires were analysed via the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) AMOS using IBM® SPSS and found that both investment and expansion factors played key roles in affecting the financial wellbeing of the micro-entrepreneurs. The results lend credence to the positive effect of Islamic microfinance products may have on MEs and indirectly support the long-term economic development for MEs. This study deliver implication to various angles. In practical part, it opens the eyes of micro-entrepreneurs to opt for the right path (expansion and investment) to achieve financial wellbeing.

Design/methodology/approach: A multivariate vector autoregression (VAR)-Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model (BEKK-GARCH) is used to assess volatility transmission across the examined markets. The sample is divided as follows. The first period ranging from 02/01/2019 to 10/03/2020 defines the pre-COVID-19 crisis. The second period is from 11/03/2020 to 05/10/2020, representing the COVID-19 crisis period. Then, a robustness test is used using exponential GARCH models after including an exogenous variable capturing the growth of COVID-19 confirmed death cases worldwide with the aim to test the accuracy of the VAR-BEKK-GARCH estimated results. Findings: Results indicate that the interconnectedness among the examined market has been intensified during the COVID-19 crisis, proving the lack of hedging opportunities. It is also found that stocks and Gold markets lead the crude oil market especially during the COVID-19 crisis, which explains the freefall of the crude oil price during the health crisis. Similarly, results show that Gold is most likely to act as a diversifier rather than a hedging tool during the current health crisis.

The entire world is now experiencing the challenge of COVID-19 infection. However, still very few evidence-based treatment options are available for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease. The present review aims to summarize the publicly available information to give a comprehensive yet balanced scientific overview of all the fat-soluble vitamins concerning their role in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The roles of different fat-soluble vitamins and micronutrients in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection have been recently explored in several studies. There are various hypotheses to suggest their use to minimize the severity of COVID-19 infection. These vitamins are pivotal in the maintenance and modulation of innate and cell-mediated, and antibody-mediated immune responses. The data reported in recent literature demonstrate that deficiency in one or more of these vitamins compromises the patients’ immune response and makes them more vulnerable to viral infections and perhaps worse disease prognosis. Vitamins A, D, E, and K boost the body’s defense mechanism against COVID-19 infection and specifically prevent its complications such as cytokine storm and other inflammatory processes, leading to increased morbidity and mortality overemphasis. However, more detailed randomized double-blind clinical pieces of evidence are required to define the use of these supplements in preventing or reducing the severity of the COVID-19 infection. © 2021 Samad et al.","COVID-19; Fat-soluble vitamins; Immune response; Micronutrients; SARS-CoV-2","alpha tocopherol; antibody; retinol; trace element; vitamin; vitamin D; vitamin K group; antiviral activity; coronavirus disease 2019; defense mechanism; disease severity; evidence based practice; human; immune response; innate immunity; nonhuman; pandemic; prognosis; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vitamin supplementation"

This cross-sectional study was carried out on oral health care workers at ten different dental hospitals in Pakistan from March to July 2020. Information on the socio-demographic status, and willingness to report for duty and treat patients during the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was assessed using the Urdu version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and Impact of Events Scale. Simple and multiple linear regression tests were used for analysis. A total of 392 OHCWs participated in this study and 25% of them had moderate to severe anxiety levels and only 14% had post-traumatic stress disorder. About 26% of the OHCWs were willing to work and treat patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and they had lower anxiety and stress scores. Greater anxiety and stress were associated with participants who were older, female, single, married, living with family and friends. The adjusted coefficients of GAD and IES scores were greater in participants who were not willing and unsure to work compared to their colleagues who were willing. The OHCWs are anxious and stressed because of the COVID-19 outbreak and that affects the perception of whether they should work and treat patients during the pandemic. © 2021 KBCSM, Zagreb.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Oral health care worker; Psychological impact; Willingness","adult; anxiety; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; dental personnel; female; Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale; human; human experiment; Impact of Events Scale; Likert scale; male; mental stress; pandemic; perception; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychology; questionnaire; work"

This research analyzes the correlation between self-efficacy, creativity perception, and productive disposition towards academic performance using path analysis and was modeled in the form of regression equation. This study involved 108 students (35 males and 72 females) at a university in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. The research instrument used was questionnaire of self-efficacy (11 items), creativity perception (15 items) and mathematical disposition (14 items). All research variable items had a Pearson correlation (r) greater than 0.25, so all items were said to be valid. The reliability coefficient of Cronbach's Alpha for self-efficacy, perceived creativity, and productive disposition were included in the high category. The results showed a correlation between self-efficacy and creativity perception with regard to productive disposition. There was also a direct correlation between self-efficacy and academic performance. Creativity perception did not show a direct influence on academic performance nor. Productive disposition had a direct influence on academic performance. There was a correlation between self-efficacy, creativity perception, and productive disposition of academic performance. Self-efficacy (happy to help other friends, dare to face criticism and challenges, and dare to compete to win a competition) had the largest contribution to academic performance while creativity perception (creative ideas must be sophisticated and complex, creative people have high curiosity, creative people find it difficult to accept different opinions from others, creativity can only be developed in certain people, and creativity comes over by chance) has the smallest one. These findings can be used as first step in understanding creative perception as a weak contribution to cognitive abilities about academic performance, even though creativity has an important role in developing mathematics performance. © 2021, Conscientia Beam.

Sarawak, the largest state in Malaysia has consistently recorded the highest cervical cancer rate in the country where nearly half of its population still live in the rural areas and is at increased risk of the disease due to inequitable access to healthcare. The countrywide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic had halted the accessibility to cervical cancer screening programme. The aim of the study is to determine the feasibility of providing primary HPV DNA test using the self-sampling method to the hard-to-reach population in the interior of Sarawak during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study where women aged between 20-80 years were recruited via convenient sampling from villages in Long Banga, Sarawak over a five-day outreach programme. Cervicovaginal self-samples were obtained and screened for the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA (HR-HPV) using the careHPVTM Test. A self-administered questionnaire was also administered to determine the sociodemographic and perception towards the self-sampling method. Results: The 55 women recruited consist of ethnic backgrounds of Penan (58.18%), Kenyah (25.45%), Iban (5.45%), Saban (3.64%), Kelabit (3.64%), Malay (1.82%) and Chinese (1.82%). The prevalence of HR-HPV was 1.85% (n=1/55). Nearly 80% of the women were unemployed, and more than half have had attended primary education. Nine (16.4%) have heard about HPV, and seven (13%) knew HPV infection could cause cervical cancer. Three of them had HPV vaccination, and only one (1.85%) knew the brand of the HPV vaccine. Although 40% preferred self-sampling over clinician-collection, only ten (18.2%) women have completed the self-collection perception questionnaire. Conclusion: Primary HPV DNA screening using the self-sampling method can be carried out in the remote areas during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising mobility restriction. © 2021, Malaysian Medical Association.

The performances of the proposed techniques were compared with the conventional multivariate correlation techniques. All techniques under study are applied on COVID-19 data sets for Malaysia and Nigeria to determine the level of association between study variables which are confirmed, discharged, and death cases. These techniques’ performances are evaluated based on the multivariate correlation (R), multivariate coefficient of determination (R^2), and Adjusted R^2. The proposed techniques showed R=0.99 and the conventional methods showed that R ranges from 0.44 to 0.73. The R^2 and the Adjusted R^2 for proposed methods are 0.98 and 0.97 while the conventional methods showed that R equals 0.53, 0.44, and 0.19 whereas Adjusted R^2 equals 0.52, 0.43, and 0.18, respectively. The proposed techniques strongly affirmed that for any patient to be discharged or die of the Covid-19, the patient must be confirmed Covid-19 positive, whereas the conventional method showed moderate to very weak affirmation.

The first is to review the past literature on the coronavirus family to map our current understanding of its epidemic outbarks and overview its social, environmental, and economic impact. The second stream of literature focused on classifying the best possible solutions under different scenarios due to the current situation. Finally, to provide future agenda for policymakers to restrain the sustainable development goals. We used Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases for the systematic literature review process. We followed a strict screening process recommended in the PRISMA guidelines for the screening and quality assessment of systematic literature review. The final 51 studies are included for the systematic literature review. A systematic review of the past literature identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS), bovine Coronavirus, canine Coronavirus, and feline Coronavirus are the significant classifications of the Coronavirus family discuss in the literature. We highlighted the potential pitfalls in the past literature, mainly serious scarce collaborative and multidisciplinary research on the pandemic, although several researchers highlighted the issue. Findings of the current study indicate that most research is in a lab setting and experimental design. For sustainable development, there is a need to start collaborative work among the nations. We provided a framework for a pandemic strategic response plan through multidisciplinary research to mitigate the impact of the recent COVID-19 pandemic and to be prepared for future episodes.

The ongoing pandemic is a global public health concern due to its sagacious impacts on environmental sustainability, social responsibility and people’s quality of life. This study primarily focuses on analysing the impact of COVID-19 (COV) on the environmental awareness (EA), sustainable consumption (SC) and social responsibility (SR). Additionally, we aspire to investigate the impact of demographics of generations and religion on the proposed nexus in this study. The data was collected from 700 participants of different age groups and religious backgrounds in Malaysia, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse this data and test the hypotheses. The findings indicate that COVID-19 has a significantly positive impact on EA, SC and SR, and the generations and religiosity moderate the relationship between COVID-19 and its impact on sustainable behaviours. This study contributes to analyse the difference in the perception of EA, SC and SR among the people that eventually will stimulate the scientific reasoning among the governments, policymakers and scientists to develop a holistic framework to combat unprecedented event such as COVID-19 and ensure the authentication of sustainable environment and exceptional quality of life.

Design/methodology/approach: Using an unbalanced panel data of 213 banks of 4 ASEAN countries, the study has deployed principal component analysis, ordinary least square, two-step dynamic system generalised method of moments and panel corrected standard errors techniques. Findings: The empirical study finds that the full-fledged application of DFI accelerates the ASEAN banking stability which not only decreases the default risk of the banks but also upturns the financial mobility in the region. The results also suggest that ASEAN banks are, with the implementation of DFI, likely to uphold the banking sector stability by reducing liquidity crisis and non-performing loans during and in the post-Covid-19 era. Therefore, accelerating digital finance in ASEAN countries is considered as one of the significant means for the banking sector stability that subsequently leads to economic and financial resilience even in the face of any crises. Originality/value: Prevailing studies have mostly investigated the association between financial inclusion and banking stability in different contexts. However, this study is unique to empirically investigate the association between DFI and the ASEAN banking stability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","ASEAN; Banking stability; COVID-19; Digital financial inclusion index; Fintech",

Students in higher education who are graduating, facing online learning challenges, and future job opportunities are among the most at-risk group for psychological issues. Due to the new normal of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited studies have been conducted concerning the mental health of students, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, this study aimed to assess student's depression, anxiety, and stress status in four countries in the Asia Pacific region, namely, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and China. This study employed a quantitative research design with a pool of 1,195 student participants. The DASS-21 questionnaire was used for data collection through an online platform to measure the severity of depression, anxiety, and stress. Descriptive statistics were conducted to achieve the research objectives, and all reliability values were reported greater than 0.70. Findings revealed that up to 38% of the students reported mild or moderate depression, anxiety, and stress, while 20.5% reported severe or extremely severe anxiety. Overall, anxiety was reported to be the most significant problem among the students, followed by depression and stress. Students are at risk of mental health challenges during the coronavirus pandemic, likely due to unexpected life changes.

However, the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 through aerosols remains unclear. In this study, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) is used to complement the investigation of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosol. The Lagrangian particle tracking method was used to analyze the dispersion of the exhaled particles from a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient under different exhale activities and different flow rates of chilled (cooling) air supply. Air sampling of the SARS-CoV-2 patient ward was conducted for 48-h measurement intervals to collect the indoor air sample for particulate with diameter less than 2.5 μm. Then, the reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted to analyze the collected air sample.

We performed a systematic review on the oncological effects of delayed surgery for patients with localised or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the targeted therapy (TT) era. Method: The protocol of this review is registered on PROSPERO(CRD42020190882). A comprehensive literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL using MeSH terms and keywords for randomised controlled trials and observational studies on the topic. Risks of biases were assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. For localised RCC, immediate surgery [including partial nephrectomy (PN) and radical nephrectomy (RN)] and delayed surgery [including active surveillance (AS) and delayed intervention (DI)] were compared. For metastatic RCC, upfront versus deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) were compared. Results: Eleven studies were included for quantitative analysis. Delayed surgery was significantly associated with worse cancer-specific survival (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.23–2.27, p < 0.01) in T1a RCC, but no significant difference was noted for overall survival. For localised ≥ T1b RCC, there were insufficient data for meta-analysis and the results from the individual reports were contradictory. For metastatic RCC, upfront TT followed by deferred CN was associated with better overall survival when compared to upfront CN followed by deferred TT (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43–0.86, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Noting potential selection bias, there is insufficient evidence to support the notion that delayed surgery is safe in localised RCC. For metastatic RCC, upfront TT followed by deferred CN should be considered. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Active surveillance; COVID-19; Delayed surgery; Nephrectomy; Renal cell carcinoma; Targeted therapy",

This illness is poorly understood as it affects COVID-19 survivors at all levels of disease severity, even younger adults, children, and those not hospitalized. While the precise definition of long COVID may be lacking, the most common symptoms reported in many studies are fatigue and dyspnoea that last for months after acute COVID-19. Other persistent symptoms may include cognitive and mental impairments, chest and joint pains, palpitations, myalgia, smell and taste dysfunctions, cough, headache, and gastrointestinal and cardiac issues. Presently, there is limited literature discussing the possible pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatments in long COVID, which the current review aims to address. In brief, long COVID may be driven by long-term tissue damage (e.g. lung, brain, and heart) and pathological inflammation (e.g. from viral persistence, immune dysregulation, and autoimmunity). The associated risk factors may include female sex, more than five early symptoms, early dyspnoea, prior psychiatric disorders, and specific biomarkers (e.g. D-dimer, CRP, and lymphocyte count), although more research is required to substantiate such risk factors. While preliminary evidence suggests that personalized rehabilitation training may help certain long COVID cases, therapeutic drugs repurposed from other similar conditions, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and mast cell activation syndrome, also hold potential.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected through the administration of paper-based and electronic questionnaires to 400 respondents out of which only 277 were found valid for analysis. Findings: The study showed that by direct relationship, the awareness and knowledge of Islamic social finance instruments have a potentially significant positive contribution to poverty alleviation during the COVID-19 pandemic except for zakat that has an insignificant positive contribution. Ethical oriental has also a significant positive contribution. Contrary to expectation, the moderating effect of ethical orientation has changed zakat and waqf to have significant negative and insignificant positive contributions, respectively. Only Islamic microfinance has endured the moderating effect to continue contributing significantly and positively to the reduction of poverty. Research limitations/implications: The study explored only the potential impact of the awareness and knowledge of Islamic social finance to mitigate the extreme poverty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Practical implications: This study clearly showed the need to create enabling laws and policies to support the operations of zakat and waqf institutions to achieve their objectives effectively and efficiently. These two institutions should be integrated with Islamic microfinance for the possibility of getting better outcomes. Social implications: There should be massive campaigns to restore religious, social and political ethics to enhance the socio-economic development of Nigerians based on the principles of brotherhood. Originality/value: This study provides unexpected and unusual results showing the inability of zakat and waqf institutions to alleviate poverty due to poor ethical orientation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Ethical orientation; Islamic microfinance); Islamic social finance (zakat; Nigeria; Poverty; Poverty alleviation; waqf",

With an emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, growing emphasis has been placed on the palliative needs of people with Parkinson’s (PwP), particularly elderly, frail, and with comorbidities. Areas covered: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses an enormous challenge on aspects of daily living in PwP and might interact negatively with a range of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS), both directly and indirectly–as a consequence of pandemic-related social and health care restrictions. Here, the authors outline some of the motor and NMS relevant to PC, and propose a pragmatic and rapidly deployable, consensus-based PC approach for PwP during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, potentially relevant also for future pandemics. Expert opinion: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses a considerable impact on PwP and their caregivers, ranging from mental health issues to worsening of physical symptoms–both in the short- and long-term, (Long-COVID) and calls for specific, personalized PC strategies relevant in a lockdown setting globally. Validated assessment tools should be applied remotely to flag up particular motor or NMS that require special attention, both in short- and long-term. © 2021 The Author(s).

Studying COVID-19 fear with stock market volatility is crucial for planning adequate portfolio diversification in international financial markets. The study used AR (1)–GARCH (1,1) to measure stock market volatility associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 fear is the ultimate cause driving public attention and stock market volatility. The results demonstrate that stock market performance and GDP growth decreased significantly through average increases during the pandemic. Further, with a 1% increase in COVID-19 cases, the stock return and GDP decreased by 0.8%, 0.56%, respectively. However, GDP growth demonstrated a slight movement with stock exchange. Moreover, public attention to the attitude of buying or selling was highly dependent on the COVID-19 pandemic reported cases index, death index, and global fear index. Consequently, investment in the gold market, rather than in the stock market, is recommended. The study also suggests policy implications for key stakeholders. © 2021 The Author(s).

Healthcare in Malaysia encompasses numerous sectors, such as academics, community, enforcement, hospital, industrial, jurisprudence, military, regulatory and research and development. In addressing the crisis brought on by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, pharmacists and technicians have been highly involved in the delivery of healthcare services. Malaysia has a distinct two-tier healthcare system and within this context, it is essential to integrate services during a crisis to maximise the available but limited medical resources. Often, the focus is on realistic and logical public–private partnerships. However, integrating different ministries offering healthcare facilities is also important and inter-agency pharmacy practice coordination must be optimised. The Malaysian Armed Forces Health Services can be primed to enhance the nation’s healthcare capacity and capability. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grip the nation and cause an unprecedented number of Malaysians to become very ill, pharmacists must be resilient in leading, adapting and integrating well-rounded strategies in their respective fields to ensure good pharmacy practice. © 2021, Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia.

COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children. However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease management and navigating through this crisis. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.","Children; COVID-19; Multisystem inflammatory syndrome; Rare disease","albumin; anakinra; C reactive protein; canakinumab; D dimer; Fc receptor; ferritin; fibrinogen; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; procalcitonin; remdesivir; tocilizumab; abdominal pain; Article; child; confusion; conjunctivitis; coronary artery aneurysm; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; disease severity; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; fever; headache; health care personnel; human; immune response; inflammation; lethargy; lymphocyte count; macrophage activation; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; neutrophil count; pathophysiology; pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome; polymerase chain reaction; rare disease; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; virus entry; vomiting; World Health Organization"

The confirmed cases in Indonesia and Philippines are the highest ranks among other ASEAN countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. To reduce the spread of the pandemic COVID-19, each country has implemented the lock-down policy differently, depending on its economic situation. Therefore, the study of the impact of lock-down across the world, particularly in ASEAN countries, is still relevant to do. In this study, we developed the lock-down model in ASEAN countries by using hybrid ARIMA-SVR and hybrid SEIR-ANN. The first hybrid is based on the time series model ARIMA, with the revision of the error is by using SVR. The second hybrid is based on the classical model of infectious diseases, SEIR, which we revise on the prediction part by using ANN. The hybrid is intended to revise the individual prediction model. The data collected per country was started from January 20, 2020 to August 5, 2020. The periods of lock-down in this study are divided into three, namely no lock-down, implemented lock-down, and the new normal periods. The strictness levels of lock-down were predicted for 60 days ahead. The results showed that the hybrid ARIMA-SVR had smaller RMSE compared with individual ARIMA, similarly, hybrid SEIR-ANN predicted S, E, I, and R more accurately compared with individual SEIR model. It has been also found that the lock down was most effectively implemented in Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia, whereas Indonesia and Philippines were inefficient countries to enforce the restriction. It is indicated by the number of cases increased significantly during the restriction periods in both countries. © 2021 The Author(s).

Andrographis paniculata, a medicinal plant commonly used for symptomatic relief of the common cold, and its phytoconstituent andrographolide, have been repeatedly identified as potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. In light of new evidence emerging since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, this rapid review was conducted to identify and evaluate the current SARS-CoV-2 antiviral evidence for A. paniculata, andrographolide, and andrographolide analogs. A systematic search and screen strategy of electronic databases and gray literature was undertaken to identify relevant primary articles. One target-based in vitro study reported the 3CLpro inhibitory activity of andrographolide as being no better than disulfiram. Another Vero cell-based study reported potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory activity for both andrographolide and A. paniculata extract. Eleven in silico studies predicted the binding of andrographolide and its analogs to several key antiviral targets of SARS-CoV-2 including the spike protein-ACE-2 receptor complex, spike protein, ACE-2 receptor, RdRp, 3CLpro, PLpro, and N-protein RNA-binding domain. In conclusion, in silico and in vitro studies collectively suggest multi-pathway targeting SARS-CoV-2 antiviral properties of andrographolide and its analogs, but in vivo data are needed to support these predictions. © The Author(s) 2021.","Andrographis paniculata; andrographolide; antiviral; bioactivity; COVID-19; herbal medicines",

Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, and stress) in Bangladesh and the factors associated with these symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: From 1 to 30 April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Findings: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms, while the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level, and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self-quarantined in the previous seven days before the survey, and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat. Conclusion: Our results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively.

This study aims to detect spatial clusters of COVID-19 in Malaysia using the Spatial Scan Statistic (SaTScan™) to guide control authorities on prioritizing locations for targeted interventions. The spatial analyses were conducted on a monthly basis at the state-level from March to September 2020. The results show that the most likely cluster of COVID-19 occurred in West Malaysia repeatedly from March to June, covering three counties (two federal territories and one neighbouring state) and moved to East Malaysia in July covering two other counties. The most likely cluster shows a tendency of having moved from the western part to the eastern part of the country. These results provide information that can be used for the evidence- based interventions to control the spread of COVID-19 in Malaysia. © the Author(s), 2021.","COVID-19; Malaysia; SaTScan™; Spatial clusters","cluster analysis; epidemiology; human; Malaysia; spatial analysis; Cluster Analysis; COVID-19; Humans; Malaysia; SARS-CoV-2; Spatial Analysis"

Forgery of normal patients' medical data to present them as COVID-19 patients is an illegitimate action that has been carried out in different ways recently. Therefore, the integrity of these data can be questionable. Forgery detection is a method of detecting an anomaly in manipulated forged data. An appropriate number of features are needed to identify an anomaly as either forged or non-forged data in order to find distortion or tampering in the original data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have contributed a major breakthrough in this type of detection. There has been much interest from both the clinicians and the AI community in the possibility of widespread usage of artificial neural networks for quick diagnosis using medical data for early COVID-19 patient screening. The purpose of this paper is to detect forgery in COVID-19 medical data by using CNN in the error level analysis (ELA) by verifying the noise pattern in the data. The proposed improved ELA method is evaluated using a type of data splicing forgery and sigmoid and ReLU phenomenon schemes. The proposed method is verified by manipulating COVID-19 data using different types of forgeries and then applying the proposed CNN model to the data to detect the data tampering. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed CNN model on the test COVID-19 data is approximately 92%. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, Iraq, like other countries, has imposed national lockdown measures, such as social distancing, restriction of automobile traffic, and industrial enterprises. This has led to reduced human activities and air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement in air quality. This study focused on the analysis of the impact of the six partial, total, and post-lockdown periods (1st partial lockdown from March 1 to16, 2020, 1st total lockdown from March 17 to April 21, 2nd partial lockdown from April 22 to May 23, 2nd total lockdown from May 24 to June 13, 3rd partial lockdown from June 14 to August 19, and end partial lockdown from August 20 to 31) on the average of daily NO2, O3, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations, as well as air quality index (AQI) in 18 Iraqi provinces during these periods (from March 1st to August 31st, 2020). The analysis showed a decline in the average of daily PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations by 24%, 15%, and 8%, respectively from March 17 to April 21, 2020 (first phase of total lockdown) in comparison to the 1st phase of partial lockdown (March 1 to March 16, 2020). Furthermore, the O3 increased by 10% over the same period. The 2nd phase of total lockdown, the 3rd partial lockdown, and the post-lockdown periods witnessed declines in PM2.5 by 8%, 11%, and 21%, respectively, while the PM10 increases over the same period. Iraqi also witnessed improvement in the AQI by 8% during the 1st phase of total lockdown compared to the 1st phase of partial lockdown. The level of air pollutants in Iraq declined significantly during the six lockdown periods as a result of reduced human activities.

In particular, we explore whether stock market declines observed in many countries can predict the size of COVID-19 stimulus packages. Moreover, we explore whether a country's level of income can augment the underlying relationship between stock market declines and stimulus packages. The findings reveal that a larger stock market decline results in a larger stimulus package; however, this effect is only observed in countries that have an income level greater than the mean and/or median per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Moreover, our results show that monetary policy is more responsive to a stock market decline than fiscal policy.

Given the novelty of the virus, and hence, lack of official guidance on effective containment strategies, individual countries opted for different containment approaches ranging from herd immunity to strict lockdown. The opposing strategies followed by the United Kingdom and its former colony, Malaysia, stand exemplary for this. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was implemented for testing in both counties. Malaysia acted with strict quarantining rules and infection surveillance. The United Kingdom followed an initially lenient, herd-immunity approach with strict lockdown only enforced weeks later. Although based on the same health-care structure historically, Malaysia developed a more unified health system compared with the United Kingdom. We suggest that this more centralized structure could be one possible explanation for why Malaysia was able to react in a more timely and efficient manner, despite its closer geographic proximity to China. We further explore how the differences in testing and quarantining strategy, as well as political situation and societal compliance could account for the discrepancy in the United Kingdom's versus Malaysia's relative success of COVID-19 containment. © 2021 The Authors.

Nine jurisdictions are considered based on their Islamic banks’ systemic importance, namely Bahrain, Brunei, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and UAE. Using the bivariate VARX model, our forecasting exercise shows that the Islamic banks’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic is not uniform across jurisdictions. While the Islamic banks’ dynamics in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait are less likely to be impaired, Bahrain, Brunei, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Turkey are expected to be relatively more affected especially in terms of their size growth. Saudi Arabia will continue leading the growth momentum of the global Islamic banking sector, and its Islamic banks’ assets are expected to reach at least $185.4 billion by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.

Many studies on the potential roles of environmental factors in the transmission of the novel COVID-19 have been published. However, the impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 remains controversial. Machine learning techniques have been used effectively in combating the COVID-19 epidemic. However, researches related to machine learning on weather conditions in spreading COVID-19 is generally lacking. Therefore, in this study, three machine learning models (Convolution Neural Network (CNN), ADtree Classifier and BayesNet) based on the confirmed cases and weather variables such as temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation are developed. This study aims to identify the best classification model to classify COVID-19 by using significant weather features chosen by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) feature selection method. The DS4C COVID-19 dataset is used to train and validate each machine learning model. Several data preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning and feature selection have been conducted on the raw dataset to ensure the quality of the training data. The performance of these machine learning algorithms is further rectified based on the selected features set by PCA. Each classifier is then optimized using different tuning parameters to achieve optimum values before comparing the output of the three classifiers against each other. The observational results have shown that the optimized CNN classifier with seven weather variables selected by PCA achieved the highest performance among all the techniques. The experimental results obtained show that the weather variables are more relevant in predicting the confirmed cases as compared to the other variables. Thus, from this result, it is evident that temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation are important features for predicting COVID-19 confirmed cases. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

This review emphasizes the changing aspects of the COVID-19 disease, featuring the cytokine storm’s pathological processes. Furthermore, we briefly reviewed potential therapeutic agents that may modulate and alleviate cytokine storms. The literature exploration was made using PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Google scholar, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases to retrieve the most recent literature on the etiology, diagnostic markers, and the possible prophylactic and therapeutic options for the management of cytokine storm in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 disease. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), continually threatens the efficiency of the immune system of the infected individuals. As the first responder, the innate immune system provides primary protection against COVID-19, affecting the disease’s progression, clinical outcome, and prognosis. Evidence suggests that the fatalities associated with COVID-19 are primarily due to hyper-inflammation and an aberrant immune function. Accordingly, the magnitude of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, (IL-6), and tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) significantly differentiate between mild and severe cases of COVID-19. The early prediction of a cytokine storm is made possible by several serum chemistry and hematological markers. The prompt use of these markers for diagnosis and the aggressive prevention and management of a cytokine release syndrome is critical in deter-mining the level of morbidity and fatality associated with COVID-19. The prophylaxis and the rapid treatment of cytokine storm by clinicians will significantly enhance the fight against the dreaded COVID-19 disease. © 2021 Rowaiye et al.","COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Fatality; Hyper-inflammation; SARS-CoV-2","Abelmoschus esculentus extract; alanine aminotransferase; anakinra; Andrographis paniculata extract; apigenin; ascorbic acid; azithromycin; baricitinib; beta1 interferon; butyric acid; C reactive protein; capsaicin; catechin; chrysin; clarithromycin; copper; creatine kinase MB; creatinine; curcumin; cym 5442; cytokine; D dimer; dexamethasone; diosmetin; Echinacea purpurea extract; Echium amoenum extract; eritoran; ferritin; fingolimod; glycyrrhizic acid; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 1; interleukin 1 receptor; interleukin 6; iron; Janus kinase; kaempferol; lactate dehydrogenase; lambda interferon; luteolin; magnesium; methylprednisolone; naringenin; omega 3 fatty acid; pacritinib; peginterferon; plant extract; probiotic agent; quercetin; remdesivir; resveratrol; sarilumab; selenium; sinecatechins; sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor; sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor modulator; tocilizumab; transfer factor; tumor necrosis factor; ulinastatin; unclassified drug; vitamin D; zinc; acute lung injury; akathisia; artificial ventilation; blood clotting disorder; bone necrosis; cataract; coronavirus disease 2019; Cushing syndrome; cytokine release; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug mechanism; drug megadose; ecchymosis; Echium; Echium amoenum; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; face erythema; fatty liver; gastritis; glaucoma; growth disorder; heart arrhythmia; hirsutism; human; hyperinflammation; hypertension; immune system; immunopathogenesis; immunosenescence; infection; myopathy; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; nonhuman; okra; osteoporosis; oxidative stress; psychosis; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; single drug dose; sleep disorder; stomach ulcer; systematic review; urea nitrogen blood level"
"The needs of traumatic brain injury survivors' caregivers and the implication required during the covid-19 pandemic: Public health issues",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104956966&doi=10.4081%2fjphr.2021.2205&partnerID=40&md5=867171d4f63863cf926545d809a1c3fe","Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors require attention and dependence from their primary caregiver. This is because TBI is a defect that affects both the psychological and physical functions of the victim. Caregivers play an essential role in providing the adequate care victims need to adjust to the new problems they may experience due to their condition, as family members alone may not be able to provide for their needs. In particular, TBI caregivers may face specific challenges when assisting their patients in handling unexpected changes to their daily routines. Therefore, this quantitative study aims to explore the needs of caregivers, their coping mechanisms towards stressful and traumatic circumstances, and how they provide care to their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design and Methods: It was conducted with ten caregivers of individuals suffering from traumatic brain injury, that were selected using a theoretical sampling method. Data were obtained using a semi-structured interview guide, which helped the caregivers provide their responses. Meanwhile, data analysis was performed using the NVIVO analysis software. Results: The results showed that there were, three significant themes namely, (a) Support needed, (b) the information need for care, and (c) developing self-resilience. The results also showed that caregivers really need support from the various parties, and the participants lack information on specific care techniques for the severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors. Conclusions: In conclusion, caregivers require approval and seek more useful information to provide excellent care to their loved ones. Being aware of the caregiver’s needs would enable them to offer improved customized care. © the Author(s), 2021.","Caregivers; Coping strategy; Pandemic COVID-19; Resilience; Traumatic brain injury","adult; anxiety; Article; caregiver; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; educational status; Glasgow coma scale; human; human experiment; middle aged; occupation; pandemic; psychological aspect; psychological resilience; quantitative study; questionnaire; semi structured interview; social support; survivor; thematic analysis; traumatic brain injury"

Fast, reliable, and early clinical assessment of the severity of the disease can help in allocating and prioritizing resources to reduce mortality. In order to study the important blood biomarkers for predicting disease mortality, a retrospective study was conducted on a dataset made public by Yan et al. in [1] of 375 COVID-19 positive patients admitted to Tongji Hospital (China) from January 10 to February 18, 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics and patient outcomes were investigated using machine learning tools to identify key biomarkers to predict the mortality of individual patient. A nomogram was developed for predicting the mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophils (%), lymphocyte (%), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and age (LNLCA)—acquired at hospital admission—were identified as key predictors of death by multi-tree XGBoost model. The area under curve (AUC) of the nomogram for the derivation and validation cohort were 0.961 and 0.991, respectively. An integrated score (LNLCA) was calculated with the corresponding death probability. COVID-19 patients were divided into three subgroups: low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups using LNLCA cutoff values of 10.4 and 12.65 with the death probability less than 5%, 5–50%, and above 50%, respectively. The prognostic model, nomogram, and LNLCA score can help in early detection of high mortality risk of COVID-19 patients, which will help doctors to improve the management of patient stratification. © 2021, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Early warning tool; Machine learning; Predicting mortality risk; Prognostic model","Biomarkers; Forecasting; Hospitals; Nomograms; Patient monitoring; C-reactive proteins; Clinical assessments; Clinical characteristics; Healthcare services; High sensitivity; Hospital admissions; Lactate dehydrogenase; Prognostic model; Machine learning"

Automated detection of lung infections and their boundaries from medical images offers a great potential to augment the patient treatment healthcare strategies for tackling COVID-19 and its impacts. Detecting this disease from lung CT scan images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose patients. However, finding the presence of infected tissues and segment them from CT slices faces numerous challenges, including similar adjacent tissues, vague boundary, and erratic infections. To eliminate these obstacles, we propose a two-route convolutional neural network (CNN) by extracting global and local features for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. Each pixel from the image is classified into the normal and infected tissues. For improving the classification accuracy, we used two different strategies including fuzzy c-means clustering and local directional pattern (LDN) encoding methods to represent the input image differently. This allows us to find more complex pattern from the image. To overcome the overfitting problems due to small samples, an augmentation approach is utilized. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved precision 96%, recall 97%, F score, average surface distance (ASD) of 2.8±0.3 mm, and volume overlap error (VOE) of 5.6±1.2%. © 2021 Ramin Ranjbarzadeh et al.",,"algorithm; cluster analysis; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; epidemiology; female; human; lung; male; pandemic; physiology; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; SARS-CoV-2; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

Many countries are still at the peak of infection. The prolonged lockdown has caused a serious impact on the socio-economy of the whole world. There is a growing concern about the link between animal’s based food product with all the contagious diseases as most of the pandemic are initiated from farming animals. The micro study of the virus or bacteria could trace the infectious pathway of the contagious diseases and find substantial problem-solving solutions. Nevertheless, the root cause of the diseases remained unknown. Because of this, it is essential to evaluate the root cause of the disease in the macro-scope of study. By discovering the designated function of all the microorganisms from the insight perspective of the Theory of Changes and other Taoism theories, we could define the effective problem-solving solution. The result of the finding has discovered that the microorganisms which bring the so called “contagious diseases” are the cure for Mother Nature to resume its equilibrium. They are the agents of decomposition and transformation of Mother Nature. Coronavirus, other viruses, and bacteria are the essential microorganisms being created by nature to decompose the excessive animals’ dead bodies that awash in the environment into smaller particles or subtracts, transforming them into useful nutrients to be absorbed and restored by Mother earth. After identifying the deadly microorganism as the cure for Mother Nature and recognizing the harm that we have done to Mother Nature, we could find out the root cause of the problem and solve the problem fundamentally. © 2021, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

The paper used a structured case study approach to analyse the impacts and responses and relied heavily on existing reports and data sources in each country. The pandemic has further revealed the vulnerability of small-scale fishing households in the region. Given the few assets of fisher households, their ability to cushion the negative impact of crises and shocks is limited. Fishers made adaptive responses such as direct fish marketing, online marketing, and home delivery services. While short-term responses of providing food and financial assistance have been helpful, long-term support to address pandemics such as COVID-19 and other stressors will require developing more resilient fishing households. The paper recommends several approaches and interventions to improve household resilience and to be better prepared for similar challenges and threats in the future. These include: i) strengthening the fishing households’ social network of friends, relatives, and neighbours to serve as both a social safety net and a bridge towards the transition to financial inclusion; ii) diversifying livelihood to reduce dependency on the fishery and provide for additional sources of income and food; iii) promoting financial inclusion through savings, credit, digital payment products, and insurance; iv) value chain upgrading through post-harvest fish handling and processing methods; and, v) providing access, especially for women, to social protection measures such as government health insurance and social security. © Asian Fisheries Society.","Coastal livelihood; Coping; Fishers; Pandemic; Vulnerability",

Food security in Sarawak was affected by the implementation of the Movement Control Order (MCO) that was introduced to curb the spread of the Covid-19 disease. The MCO, and the subsequent phases that followed, imposed a varying degree of restrictions on movements in the country. This measure had serious repercussions on food security as it affects the distribution of food as well as how people access food. This raises questions of how secure households are in terms of food security, how do they ensure food security for their households and what are their greatest challenge in ensuring food security. This paper seeks to address those questions by examining the experiences and perceptions on food security during the pandemic based on the responses of 235 respondents. Findings indicated that most households are food secure i.e. having similar access to food as prior to MCO and have not skipped any meals. In order to achieve this, households had to resort to various measures including switching their food sources, shopping online, and going without their preferred food. Significantly, the finding shows that food security means more than just having enough food but should also incorporate elements of variety, types and quantity of food. It also shows that the greatest challenge in achieving and maintaining household food security lies in the way household cope with the changes brought, both directly and indirectly, by the pandemic. © 2021, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

In this current COVID-19 pandemic, many clinicians would differ from this treatment as steroid is considered an immunosuppressive drug and could risk the patient of developing severe adverse effects if contracting COVID-19. This is a retrospective study based in Sabah, Malaysia, examining the prevalence of COVID-19 infection following musculoskeletal corticosteroid injection from 1 December 2019 until 30 June 2020 in the sports medicine clinic and the orthopedic clinic. Patients who received musculoskeletal corticosteroid injection were called by telephone and asked about visits to the emergency department or government health clinic for influenza-like illness symptoms or severe acute respiratory infection that would require screening of COVID-19. Thirty-five patients who responded to the call were included, with mean ages of 47.9 years ± 15.1. 52% were male respondents, while 48% were female. 25% of them were diabetics, and 2.9% of them had a history of lymphoproliferative disorders. The mean pain score before injection was 6.74 ± 1.03 and after injection pain was 2.27 ± 1.63. In this study, there were 11.4% (n = 4) with minor complications of steroid injection, that is, skin discoloration. Nonetheless, there were no severe complications due to corticosteroids reported. There were no reported cases of COVID-19 among the respondents following corticosteroid injection. Musculoskeletal pain would affect a person's well-being and activities; thus, its management requires that careful consideration with risk-benefit analysis be made before administering musculoskeletal corticosteroid injection during COVID-19 pandemic.

Meteorological and environmental factors, in both laboratory and epidemiological studies, have been reported to affect the survival and transmission of the virus. In this study, the possible effects of location-specific meteorological parameters in a tropical climate on new daily COVID-19 infection (NDI) are investigated in Kuala Lumpur from 14 March 2020 to 31 August 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was imposed on ambient temperature (T) and absolute humidity (AH) to explore their nonlinear relationship with NDI. Piecewise linear regression was then used to further discern the relationships below and above the threshold values of both T and AH. The relationship between T and NDI, which was linear and statistically significant for T > 29.7°C, showed that each unit rise in temperature increases NDI by about 3.210% (CI: 1.372-7.976). AH had a more pronounced linear association with NDI for AH ≤ 22.6 g/m3 but tended to flatten the exposure-response curve above this value. A 1 g/m3 increase in AH increases NDI by 3.807% (CI: 2.064-5.732). Generally, the results indicated a positive association between T and NDI, particularly above 29.7°C, while the association with AH showed a stronger positive relationship below 22.6 g/m3.

Though imperceptible by the naked eye, the medical, sociological and economical implications caused by this newly discovered virus have been and will continue to be a great impediment to our lives. This health threat has already caused over two million deaths worldwide in the span of a year and its mortality rate is projected to continue rising. In this review, the potential of algae in combating the spread of COVID-19 is investigated since algal compounds have been tested against viruses and algal anti-inflammatory compounds have the potential to treat the severe symptoms of COVID-19. The possible utilization of algae in producing value-added products such as serological test kits, vaccines, and supplements that would either mitigate or hinder the continued health risks caused by the virus is prominent. Many of the characteristics in algae can provide insights on the development of microalgae to fight against SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses and contribute in manufacturing various green and high-value products. © 2021 The Author(s).

The study aimed to identify therapeutic approaches and drugs that can potentially be used as interventions in Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) management. A systematic scoping review was conducted. Articles reporting clinical evidence of therapeutic management of COVID-19 were selected from three different research databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct). From the database search, 31 articles were selected based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review paper showed that remdesivir and ivermectin significantly reduced viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) activity. On the other hand, convalescent plasma (CP) significantly improved COVID-19 clinical symptoms. Additionally, the use of corticosteroid increased survival rates in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Findings also indicated that both hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir were effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, lopinavir–ritonavir combination was not effective against COVID-19. Finally, ribavirin, galidesivir, and sofosbuvir showed potential therapeutic benefit in treating COVID-19, but there is a lack of clinical evidence on their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir, ivermectin, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and CP are the therapeutic agents that can potentially be used in COVID-19 management. © 2021 De Gruyter.

Methods: We report an anonymous online survey in Thailand conducted in May 2020 to assess public perceptions of three interventions in the Thai context: isolation, quarantine and social distancing. A total of 1,020 participants, of whom 52% were women, responded to the survey. Results: Loss of income was the main concern among respondents (>80% for all provinces in Thailand). Traditional media and social media were important channels for communication during the pandemic. A total of 92% of respondents reported that they changed their social behaviour even before the implementation of government policy with 94% reporting they performed social distancing, 97% reported using personal protective equipment such as masks and 95% reported using sanitizer products. Conclusions: This study showed a high level of compliance from individuals with government enforced or voluntarily controls such as quarantine, isolation and social distancing in Thailand.

This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs amid the pandemic and their association with religious coping. A cross-sectional study design was applied. The scales utilized were Malay versions of the Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE M) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS M). In total, 200 HCWs were recruited. HCWs scored higher in positive religious coping (mean: 21.33) than negative religious coping (mean: 10.52). The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 36.5% and 29.5%. Both positive and negative religious coping were significantly associated with anxiety (p < 0.01) and depression (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Positive coping predicted reduction in anxiety (adjusted b = −0.15, p = 0.001) and log-transformed depression score (adjusted b = −0.019, p = 0.025). Negative coping predicted increment of anxiety (adjusted b = 0.289, p < 0.001) and log-transformed depression score (adjusted b = 0.052, p < 0.001). Positive religious coping is vital in reducing anxiety and depression among HCWs amid the pandemic.

We found that more than half of Malaysian healthcare workers in this sample experienced burnout. Direct involvement in COVID-19 screening or treatment, having a medical condition, and less psychological support in the workplace emerged to be the significant factors in personal-, work-, and patient-related burnout. Participants described their workloads, uncertainties caused by the pandemic, challenging work–family balance, and stretched workplace relationships as the sources of burnout. Exhaustion appeared to be the major symptom, and many participants utilized problem-focused coping to deal with the adversities experienced during the pandemic. Participants reported physical-, occupational-, psychological-, and social-related negative impacts resulting from burnout.

The average occurrences of microplastic pieces per stomach in fish and shrimps according to 10% digested KOH reagent were 2.73 ± 0.15, 4.11 ± 1.12 and 3.78 ± 1.12, respectively. The most common shape of microplastics in fish and shrimp was fiber. Black was the most frequent color found followed by blue, white and red. Microplastic size found in this study ranged from 150 μm to 5 mm and 70% of microplastic size was less than 1 mm. Five polymer types were reported including polyester, rayon, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene and paint. It is worth noting that textile fiber also appeared in stomachs of fish and shrimp. It might have been caused by the fact that during the lockdown period people change their way of life such as doing more laundry thus, releasing more cloth fibers (microplastics) into sewer and lake.

Using daily stock market return data on 10 different industry sectors, we show that both Islamic and conventional indices depict a similar pattern, but Islamic equities exhibit lower risk, indicating a subdued reaction to market movements. However, as the COVID-19 evolves from an epidemic to a pandemic the trend changes, with Consumer Services, Financials, Healthcare, and Oil & Gas sector betas depicting an overreaction in Islamic equities. These results remain robust to multiple additional tests.

In this regard, this study delineates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the gambling industry using Macao, the world’s largest destination-dependent gambling hub, as a case. Using a series of quantitative analysis (ARIMA, correlation, and regression) on longitudinal data, the findings reveal that the revenue of the Macao gambling industry is significantly dependent on tourist arrivals, and that the industry is evidenced–using predicted and actual values–to experience an unprecedented decline in revenue as a result of plummeting tourist arrivals. The findings also indicate that Macao is a gambling-dependent economy as the decline in gambling revenue coincides with the decline in economic indicators such as GDP, median salary, and unemployment rate.

As susceptibility and severity may not co-occur, it is necessary to examine both components of disease threat. Objective: To examine the knowledge, threat perception, response efficacy, and associations with intended and concurrent COVID-19 preventive measures during a period of receding cases in Malaysia. Methods: An online survey of 230 respondents was conducted from 1 to Jul 15 2020 using a 50-item questionnaire to study intention for COVID-19 preventive measures. Snowball sampling technique and the 2-step factor analysis of data was done. Results: Good knowledge of the disease acquired mainly from the mass media and internet rather than family and friends were reported among the respondents. Severity of COVID-19 compared to other flu-like diseases was acknowledged, but a low perception of risk and likelihood of contracting the disease was observed. Beliefs in the efficacy of public preventive measures (quarantine, physical distancing, movement restriction and screening) were high. Face mask and personal hygiene ranked as the most effective individual preventive measures. Intentions for self-quarantine and testing were strong if flu symptoms were perceived. Perceived susceptibility is moderately associated with perceived severity and efficacy of recommended preventive measures. A stronger relationship was found between perceived efficacy of preventive measures and intended and concurrent health-protective measures. Conclusion: The findings suggest that perceptions of disease threat need to focus on susceptibility and severity, and perceptions of severity need to consider perceived severity for self and others. © IJCRR.","COVID-19; Malaysia; Preventive measures; Protection Motivation Theory; Public perception",

Materials and Methods: All urology referrals received from March 18, 2020 to April 28, 2020 (i.e., during the MCO period) were included and assessed prospectively. For comparison, a retrospective study covering the period from February 1, 2020 to March 17, 2020 (i.e. pre-MCO period) was conducted. Parameters measured and compared include sources of referral, type of cases, outcomes, admission status, and COVID-19 status of patients referred. Results: The majority of referrals for urology were received from the emergency department during MCO (42.9%), followed by the medical ward (28.6%) and surgical ward (2.3%). In terms of the type of cases referred, during the MCO, the highest number of hematuria cases (22.5%) was received and a high number of Benign Prostate Hypertrophy (BPH) and urethral stricture cases (18.8%). Conservative measures remain the most commonly adopted outcomes/management for both pre and during MCO. The number of admissions required for urology referral showed a slight difference between pre and during MCO. Conclusion: The workload of urology referral in a COVID-19 designated tertiary hospital did not change despite MCO. This supports that the urology team still has an important role to play as a subspecialty unit in managing urology emergencies, even when elective surgeries and procedures are being reduced or rescheduled. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

We aimed to describe the psychological impact and experiences of family members of silent mentors during the COVID-19 pandemic using qualitative interviews. Many expressed feelings of remorse and unrest about the unprecedented delay of the SMP. The delay increased negative emotions particularly among some elderly family members; however, there was no prominent negative effect on their functional health and well-being. Several participants relayed the belief that the soul cannot rest until the body receives a proper burial while some worried about the deterioration of the physical condition of the mentors. In conclusion, findings provide insights into the importance of not overlooking the mental health implications of delaying the SMP in future outbreaks or crises. © The Author(s) 2021.","COVID-19; death; delay; funeral; grief",

It was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020. The COVID-19 virus is also a zooanthroponosis, that can be transmitted from human to animals. Malaysia has seven wild cats' species and five mustelids which can be found in the forests of Peninsular Malaysia as well as in captivity, in zoos and conservation facilities. Human beings have the potential to spread the COVID-19 virus to wild mustelids and big cat species, which may threaten its populations in Peninsular Malaysia.

This virus is associated with a spectrum of respiratory illness ranging from asymptomatic, mild to severe pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Accumulating evidence supports that COVID-19 is not merely a respiratory illness per se, but potentially affects other organ systems including the placenta. SARS-CoV-2 gains access to human cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). The abundance of ACE-2 on the placental cell surface, especially the syncytiotrophoblasts, could potentially contribute to vertical transplacental transmission to the fetus following maternal COVID-19 infection. Intriguingly, despite the placentas being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, there are very few newborns that manifest virus-induced diseases. The protective effects of the placental barrier to viral infection, limiting the spread of the virus to newborn infants, remain a mystery. The detrimental role of COVID-19 in pregnancies is largely debatable, although COVID-19 maternal infection has been implicated in unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. In this review, we summarize the pathological features manifested in placenta due to COVID-19 maternal infection that have been previously reported, and relate them to the possible disease manifestation. The potential mechanistic pathways associated with transplacental viral transmission and adverse pregnancy outcomes are also discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

Nonetheless, the situation seems to be better controlled with the recent COVID-19 vaccines roll-out globally as active immunisation to prevent COVID-19. The extensive usage and trials done in recent outbreak in China has shown the effectiveness of traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM) in improving the wellbeing of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment guidelines has listed a number of recommended concoctions meant for COVID-19 patients. Licorice, more commonly known as Gancao in Chinese Pinyin, is known as one of the most frequently used ingredients in TCM prescriptions for treatment of epidemic diseases. Interestingly, it is deemed as food ingredient as well, where it is normally used in Western cuisines’ desserts and sweets. The surprising fact that licorice appeared in the top 10 main ingredients used in TCM prescriptions in COVID-19 has drawn great attention from researchers in revealing its biological potential in overcoming this disease. To date, there are no comprehensive review on licorice and its benefits when used in COVID-19.

The countries hit hardest by the pandemic have been the so called developed ones of Western Europe and the USA. Equating development to mega cities has been shown to be misplaced. The pandemic has spread fastest in crowded cities such as New York and Los Angeles. Aside from overpopulated cities, ignoring the environment and the need for healthy living conditions are other important reasons for their failure to control the epidemic. Yet, countries such as Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have had very low infection rates relatively, even though most of their populations live in large urban centers. The difference may be due to the extensive practice of using face masks in these countries. The need to emphasize and rely on science and technology to solve the problems of humankind is among the key lessons that the pandemic has taught us.

We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate the overall effect of ivermectin on the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, and preprint repository databases (up to February 28, 2021). Random-effects and inverse variance heterogeneity meta-analysis were used to pool the odds ratio of individual trials. The risk of bias was appraised using Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Results: Six randomized controlled trials were included in this analysis with a total of 658 patients who were randomized to receive ivermectin and 597 patients randomized in the control group who did not receive ivermectin. Of six trials, four had an overall high risk of bias. The estimated effect of ivermectin indicated mortality benefits (pooled odds ratio = 0.21; 95% confidence interval 0.11–0.42, n = 1255), with some evidence against the hypothesis of ‘no significant difference’ at the current sample size.

Secondly, to examine the co-movements between the three monetary systems using wavelet coherence analysis. The findings indicate that an investor with momentum strategy can consider investing in Bitcoin and Gold market, while the contrarian investment strategy is more advisable for the fiat money market during crisis period. Furthermore, the wavelet coherence analysis indicates that Bitcoin currency is the most leading monetary system during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, followed by gold. However, US dollar mostly leads Bitcoin during non-crisis periods, while Gold is found to lead the US dollar throughout the sample period of the study. This suggests that the cryptocurrency system or gold standard should be considered as the alternative monetary system for better economic stability specially during the crisis period. Moreover, Bitcoin and gold had an anti-phase correlation before the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, which implies better benefits of hedging in the non-crisis period, while during a crisis they are moving together across different horizons. In contrast, Bitcoin and Fiat Money are strongly correlated during non-crisis periods, while during covide-19 pandemic crisis the correlation is statistically insignificant.

Thus, factors influencing students’ health behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak should be examined. Purpose: To our knowledge, little is known about stress, adversity quotient, and health behaviors of university students in Thailand. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the relationships among socioeconomic factors, stress, and adversity quotient influencing university students’ health behavior during the COVID-19 crisis. Patients and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional predictive study; it was included 416 undergraduate students ≥18 years of age at a university in Thailand. We used descriptive statistics, chi-squared test, and stepwise multiple linear regression for data analysis. Results: The results indicated that most participants were women (71.90%), and the highest proportion of students were enrolled in College of Politics and Governance (25.24%). Most of the students had a high stress level (M = 3.54, SD = 0.53), high adversity quotient (M = 3.77, SD = 0.63), and good health behavior (M = 3.06, SD = 0.53). Adversity quotient, stress, and current faculty/college were significant predictors of health behaviors of under- grad students (total variance: 37.2%). Conclusion: Total adversity quotient was the strongest predictor of health behavior, fol- lowed by stress and current faculty/colleges. On the basis of our results, we suggested that faculty members, caretakers, and interdisciplinary care teams should consider adversity quotient and stress in developing activities to encourage and promote students’ physical and mental health behaviors, particularly during the COVID-19. © 2021 Suksatan et al.","Adversity quotient; COVID-19 pandemic; Health behaviors; Stress; Thai students","adult; Article; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; female; health behavior; health promotion; human; male; mental health; mental stress; pandemic; school stress; socioeconomics; Thailand; undergraduate student; university student"

This study demonstrates that the MCO was effective within the target of twice the two-week incubation period of COVID-19, with cases from community transmission and importation through the air and southern land borders. Selangor and Sarawak had higher cases in early MCO due to situational factors. In conclusion, MCO has been efficacious, with different states attaining different levels of case reduction due to individualised reasons. © 2021, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.

The primary purpose of this research is to investigate challenges faced and benefits availed by the teachers at the tertiary level in universities of Pakistan and Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the purpose a mixed-method approach is employed to answer the three research questions of the present study. The quantitative data is obtained from the responses of 66 teachers, teaching online in Mehran UET Pakistan and 102 teachers from Indonesian university. The personal, technological, and pedagogical challenges were analyzed by descriptive statistics on SPSS. Thus, the independent-samples t-test was run to test for statistically significant differences faced by teachers in both countries. Findings: The findings revealed that there were no statistically significant differences found in personal, and pedagogical challenges faced by both countries' teachers, whereas there is a significant difference in facing technological challenges between Pakistani and Indonesian teachers. The benefits of online teaching were investigated qualitatively by conducting semi-structured interviews with 10 teachers 5 from each country. There are very positive aspects of online teaching revealed in the interviews. Research limitations/implications: The paper includes implications for the development of Computer Assisted Language Learning, the development of technology integrated courses, and for managing the balance between physical and online classes. Practical implications: The findings of the study have implications on finding out the solutions of the derived challenges, further it suggests to concentrate on students of public and private universities in Pakistan and Indonesia so that a comparison of challenges faced by teachers and faced by students can be researched and evaluated and it can generate significantly different results. Social implications: The implications on the research society and the teachers and designers' communities are very clear in this research because it paves the way forward towards the blending of technology in any way either synchronously/ asynchronously into education, further researches can be done on designing the new concepts, courses, instructional platforms for students and investigate the new dimensions and effects of them. Originality/value: Findings have value, because two countries' context (developing countries) with respect to the comparison of the challenges and benefits is better understood, it would have different results if had done in the developed countries. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Benefits; Challenges; COVID-19; Online teaching; Technology integration",

The outbreak of COVID-19 has created more pressure on the labor market. The pandemic reduces employment opportunities as most of the companies have stopped their recruitment process to cut their operational costs, which increases the rate of graduate unemployment in Bangladesh. Hence, this study aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on graduate employability in Bangladesh that adversely affects the income of families and eventually the nation’s economy. A literature review has been conducted from secondary sources to evaluate the impact, which shows that the rate of graduate unemployment increased from 47% to 58% in 2020 with an expected annual loss estimated at $53 million. Findings also reveal that the prime reasons for graduate employability are low demand and huge supply of graduates in the labor market, lack of professional skills of graduates, ineffective education system, etc. The study suggests that the government of Bangladesh should develop some policies to overcome this problem such as ensuring employment subsidies, implementing skills development programs, improving labor market flexibility, initiating credit programs for generating employment, and developing entrepreneurial ecosystems in Bangladesh. © 2021, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business.

"Physical activity patterns, psychosocial well-being and coping strategies among older persons with cognitive frailty of the “we-rise” trial throughout the covid-19 movement control order",2021,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102845369&doi=10.2147%2fCIA.S290851&partnerID=40&md5=c250d4b4a845f39616e90c3334c47af9","Purpose: Older persons have been identified as a vulnerable population with respect to the novel coronavirus outbreak, COVID-19. Aiming to “flatten the curve” a strict Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented in Malaysia. Older adults with cognitive frailty are prone to physical, cognitive and psychosocial decline. This study aims to compare physical activity patterns, psychological wellbeing and coping strategies of older persons with cognitive frailty in the “WE-RISE” trial (intervention versus control) throughout this period. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted as a sub-analysis of the ongoing “WE-RISE” randomized controlled trial. This study included 42 community-dwelling older adults, aged 60 years and above, with cognitive frailty, stratified into intervention (n=21) and control (n=21) groups who are receiving a multi-domain intervention and usual care, respectively, within the Klang Valley, Malaysia. Phone call interviews were conducted during the MCO period. Physical activity patterns were assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Psychological well-being was assessed using Flourishing Scale (FS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) assessed coping strategies. Data were analysed descriptively and with independent samples t-test. Results: The WE-RISE intervention group had significantly higher levels of estimated resting energy expenditure (MET) for “walking activity” (I:μ=1723.1±780.7;C:μ=537.4 ±581.9)(p<0.001), “moderate activity” (I:μ=1422.8±1215.1;C:μ=405.7±746.9)(p=0.002) and “total physical activity” (I: μ=3625.9±3399.3;C:μ=994.6±1193.9)(p=0.002). The intervention group was also significantly more independent in functional activities (μ=1.76±1.73) as compared to the control group (μ=5.57±8.31) (p<0.05). Moreover, significant higher self-perception of living a meaningful life and feeling respected (p<0.05) was demonstrated in regard to psychological well-being in the intervention group. Regarding coping strategies, the intervention group relied significantly on the domains of religion (I:μ=6.43±0.99;C: μ=6.09±1.09)(p<0.05) and planning (I:μ=4.81±0.75; C:μ=4.04±1.28)(p<0.05) whilst the control group relied on humour (C:μ=3.14±1.19; I:μ=2.38±0.74)(p<0.05). Conclusion: Participants of the WE-RISE intervention group were more physically active, functionally independent and had higher self-perceived social-psychological prosperity regarding living a meaningful life and feeling respected; whilst both groups relied on positive coping strategies during the MCO. These results indicate that it is vital to ensure older persons with cognitive frailty remain physically active and preserve their psychosocial wellbeing to be more resilient in preventing further decline during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Murukesu et al.","Cognitive frailty; COVID-19; Geriatric health introduction; Physical activity; Psychological well-being; Public health","aged; Article; brief coping orientation to problems experienced; clinical article; cognitive defect; community dwelling person; controlled study; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; disease control; energy expenditure; female; flourishing scale; frailty; functional activities questionnaire; General Health Questionnaire; geriatric patient; human; international physical activity questionnaire; Malaysia; male; pandemic; physical activity; psychological well-being; randomized controlled trial; respect; self concept; social psychology; Student t test; telephone interview; walking; wellbeing; cognition; energy metabolism; exercise; frail elderly; frailty; independent living; interview; longitudinal study; middle aged; psychology; very elderly; Adaptation, Psychological; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition; COVID-19; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Female; Frail Elderly; Frailty; Humans; Independent Living; Interviews as Topic; Longitudinal Studies; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2"

The incidence and pathophysiology of these manifestations remain elusive. In this worldwide survey of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed cardiac arrhythmias, we describe clinical characteristics associated with various arrhythmias, as well as global differences in modulations of routine electrophysiology practice during the pandemic. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection worldwide with and without incident cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with documented atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia, nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, atrioventricular block, or marked sinus bradycardia (heart rate<40 bpm) were classified as having arrhythmia. Deidentified data was provided by each institution and analyzed. Results: Data were collected for 4526 patients across 4 continents and 12 countries, 827 of whom had an arrhythmia. Cardiac comorbidities were common in patients with arrhythmia: 69% had hypertension, 42% diabetes, 30% had heart failure, and 24% had coronary artery disease. Most had no prior history of arrhythmia. Of those who did develop an arrhythmia, the majority (81.8%) developed atrial arrhythmias, 20.7% developed ventricular arrhythmias, and 22.6% had bradyarrhythmia. Regional differences suggested a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation in Asia compared with other continents (34% versus 63%). Most patients in North America and Europe received hydroxychloroquine, although the frequency of hydroxychloroquine therapy was constant across arrhythmia types. Forty-three percent of patients who developed arrhythmia were mechanically ventilated and 51% survived to hospital discharge. Many institutions reported drastic decreases in electrophysiology procedures performed. Conclusions: Cardiac arrhythmias are common and associated with high morbidity and mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. There were significant regional variations in the types of arrhythmias and treatment approaches. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Section 2 of the paper discusses the need to re-think the approach taken in presenting Islamic economics and the possible impact this would have in dealing with the post COVID-19 economy. It is important to realize that Islamic economics must be seen as a 3-sector economy, in which private, public, and not-for-profit sectors have their role to play. In addition, a new decision-making model is needed, one that goes beyond individual self-interest and takes into consideration ‘others' in one's choices, i.e., decisions that have a social impact. It is also imperative that we bring Islamic banking and finance in-line with the bigger development agenda that takes into concern the well-being of all others.

Healthcare utilization services in Malaysia remains relatively low as compared to the rate in most high-income countries and some gaps exist across socioeconomic status. After the financial handouts deemed Household Living Aid (HLA) to low-income earners, Malaysia has recently implemented a financial health protection scheme toward for low-income group known as PeKa B40 to improve their access for healthcare services. This study aims to determine the healthcare utilization among the low-income population living in urban Klang Valley, and to explore the relationship between healthcare utilization with the demographic characteristics of this population. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study using face to face structured questionnaire. All 447 respondents included were low-income earners enrolled in the HLA. Chi-square analysis and multiple logistic regression were used to examine association between the risk factors and healthcare utilization. Results: The response rate was 93.5%. The healthcare utilization among the respondents during the partial lockdown period was 19.5% and 33.1% during the recovery lockdown period. Enrollment in the PeKa B40 scheme among the 7.6% respondents was not associated with healthcare utilization. After controlling for the variables, those aged 60 years and above [AOR: 1.87; 95% (CI): (1.07; 3.27)], self-rated poor health status [AOR: 2.16; 95% (CI): (1.07; 4.34)], having NCDs [AOR: 4.21; 95% (CI): (2.23; 7.94)], and being hospitalized in the past 12 months [AOR: 3.54; 95% (CI): (1.46; 8.62)], were more likely to utilize healthcare services as compared to their counterparts. Conclusion: The results from this study is valuable for policy recommendations to improve on the coverage of the PeKa B40 scheme and healthcare access for the low-income population especially during the pandemic. © The Author(s) 2021.","access to care; community health; health outcomes; healthcare utilization; low-income population",

This has led to increased stress and anxiety among employees, which explicably affects their satisfaction with life. Thus, the present study analyses the effect of COVID-19 induced stressors (role overload, lifestyle choices, family distraction, and occupational discomfort) on employees’ distress levels and job performance. Subsequently, the impact of such distress and job performance on the employees’ life satisfaction is analyzed during the lockdown period. Methodology: Data was collected from 433 working professionals of private and public organizations in the Delhi and NCR region of India during India’s third and fourth phase of lockdown via a survey, which was distributed online. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was applied first to establish the validity of this study’s model (measurement model validity) and subsequently test the hypothesized relationships in the model (structural model). Results: The COVID-19 induced stressors, i.e., role overload, lifestyle choices, and occupational discomfort, were significant predictors of distress during the lockdown. It has been found that role overload and change in lifestyle choice did not significantly affect job performance. Family distraction, occupational discomfort, and distress were significant in impacting job performance, with distress being the most significant one. During the COVID-19 pandemic, life satisfaction has reduced due to a significant increase in distress levels and lowered job performances. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Family distraction; Job performance; Life satisfaction; Occupational discomfort; Role overload; SARS coronavirus",

On a daily basis the number of deaths associated with COVID- 19 is rapidly increasing. The main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is through the air (airborne transmission). This review details the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the aerodynamics, and different modes of transmission (e.g. droplets, droplet nuclei, and aerosol particles). SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by an infected person during activities such as expiration, coughing, sneezing, and talking. During such activities and some medical procedures, aerosols and droplets contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 particles are formed. Depending on their sizes and the environmental conditions, such particles stay viable in the air for varying time periods and can cause infection in a susceptible host. Very few studies have been conducted to establish the mechanism or the aerodynamics of virus-loaded particles and droplets in causing infection. In this review we discuss the various forms in which SARS- CoV-2 virus particles can be transmitted in air and cause infections. © 2021, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche.

This newly recognized virus is highly transmissible, and no clinically approved vaccine or antiviral medicine is currently available. Early diagnosis of infected patients through effective screening is needed to control the rapid spread of this virus. Chest radiography imaging is an effective diagnosis tool for COVID-19 virus and followup. Here, a novel hybrid multimodal deep learning system for identifying COVID-19 virus in chest X-ray (CX-R) images is developed and termed as the COVID-DeepNet system to aid expert radiologists in rapid and accurate image interpretation. First, Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Butterworth bandpass filter were applied to enhance the contrast and eliminate the noise in CX-R images, respectively. Results from two different deep learning approaches based on the incorporation of a deep belief network and a convolutional deep belief network trained from scratch using a large-scale dataset were then fused. Parallel architecture, which provides radiologists a high degree of confidence to distinguish healthy and COVID-19 infected people, was considered. The proposed COVID-DeepNet system can correctly and accurately diagnose patients with COVID-19 with a detection accuracy rate of 99.93%, sensitivity of 99.90%, specificity of 100%, precision of 100%, F1-score of 99.93%, MSE of 0.021%, and RMSE of 0.016% in a large-scale dataset. This system shows efficiency and accuracy and can be used in a real clinical center for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 virus and treatment follow-up with less than 3 s per image to make the final decision. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The majority of the participants (n=163; 70.3%) believed COVID-19 is a health threat to their community in the early months of the pandemic. Moreover, the majority (93%) also believed that the lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic was necessary to contain the pandemic. Encouragingly, 86.6% reported that they did not go to any crowded places during the pandemic with more female students avoiding crowded places compared to male students (91.6% versus 78.7%, respectively, P = 0.005). The majority (91%) also reported that they were following the strategies recommended by the authorities to prevent the spread of the virus. Encouragingly, 54.3% reported that the pandemic either had no effect or just a limited effect on their studies. However, 38.5% reported that they always felt or frequently felt nervous or anxious during the pandemic. Conclusion: The study showed that pharmacy students had good knowledge as well as positive attitudes and good practices towards COVID-19 and the preventive measures. However, during the early months, the pandemic did have a negative psychological impact on a number of students. Consequently, proactive psychological and social support services to the students should be considered during the current and future pandemics. In addition, it is important to consider and proactively address key issues that could cause stress and anxiety among students when shifting to distance learning and assessments. © 2021 Alrasheedy et al.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Mental health; Pharmacy; Saudi Arabia",

We adjust previous estimates of mortality rates by adjusting for lower healthcare capacity to treat critically ill patients in lower-income countries. Furthermore, we adjust previous estimates of the economic loss from fatalities by controlling for the age profile of victims. The results show significant economic gains in adopting mitigation strategies, but the marginal gains decrease when moving from mitigation to suppression strategies.

Recently, a new form of coronavirus was identified in the city of Wuhan, China. Interestingly, the genomic architecture of the virus did not match with any of the existing genomic sequencing data of previously sequenced CoVs. This had led scientists to confirm the emergence of a new CoV strain. Originally, named as 2019-nCoV, the strain is now called as SARS-CoV-2. High serum levels of proinflammatory mediators, namely, interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-1β, IL-6, interferon-gamma (IFNγ), chemoattractant protein-1, and IFN-inducible protein, have been repeatedly observed in subjects who were infected with this virus. In addition, the virus demonstrated strong coagulation activation properties, leading to further the understanding on the SARS-CoV2. To our understanding, these findings are unique to the published literature. Numerous studies have reported anomalies, namely, decline in the number of lymphocytes, platelets and albumins; and a rise in neutrophil count, aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, troponins, creatinine, complete bilirubin, D-dimers, and procalcitonin. Supplementation of calcium during the SARS CoV-2 associated hyperactive stage of calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR) may be harmful to the cardio-renal system. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of CaSR may prevent the increase in the levels of intracellular calcium, oxidative, inflammatory stress, and cardio-renal cellular apoptosis induced by high cytokines level in COVID-19 infection. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Calcium Sensing Receptor; COVID-19 infection; CRP; Myeloperoxidase; Neutrophils; SARS CoV-2",

There is no specific pharmacological antiviral therapeutic option to date available for COVID-19 management. Also, there is an urgent need to discover effective medicines, prevention, and control methods because of the harsh death toll from this novel coronavirus infection. Acute respiratory tract infections, significantly lower respiratory tract infections, and pneumonia are the primary cause of millions of deaths worldwide. The role of micronutrients, including trace elements, boosted the human immune system and was well established. Several vitamins such as vitamin A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate; microelement including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; omega-3 fatty acids as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid plays essential physiological roles in promoting the immune system. Furthermore, zinc is an indispensable microelement essential for a thorough enzymatic physiological process. It also helps regulate gene-transcription such as DNA replication, RNA transcription, cell division, and cell activation in the human biological system. Subsequently, zinc, together with natural scavenger cells and neutrophils, are also involved in developing cells respon-sible for regulating nonspecific immunity. The modern food habit often promotes zinc deficiency; as such, quite a few COVID-19 patients presented to hospitals were frequently diagnosed as zinc deficient. Earlier studies documented that zinc deficiency predisposes patients to a viral infection such as herpes simplex, common cold, hepatitis C, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because of reducing antiviral immunity. This manuscript aimed to discuss the various roles played by zinc in the management of COVID-19 infection. © 2021 Samad et al.","COVID-19; Efficacy; Immune-boosting; Microelement; Pandemic; Pneumonia; Viral infections; Zinc therapy","alpha tocopherol; antiinfective agent; ascorbic acid; azithromycin; bradykinin; caspase; claudin 1; copper; cyanocobalamin; DNA; docosahexaenoic acid; folic acid; hydroxychloroquine; icosapentaenoic acid; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; iron; magnesium; omega 3 fatty acid; pyridoxine; reactive oxygen metabolite; retinol; RNA; selenium; superoxide dismutase; tight junction protein; trace element; transcription factor; tumor necrosis factor; vitamin D; zinc; adaptive immunity; apoptosis; bronchitis; cell activation; cell division; common cold; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; DNA replication; DNA synthesis; enzyme activation; feeding behavior; genetic transcription; hepatitis C; herpes simplex; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; immune system; Influenza virus; innate immunity; lower respiratory tract infection; neutrophil; pandemic; pneumonia; primary health care; protein expression; public health; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; respiratory epithelium; respiratory tract infection; Review; risk factor; RNA transcription; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus infection; whole genome sequencing; zinc deficiency"

Considering the explosive growth of the pandemic repurposing existing medicines may be cost-effective and may be approved for use in COVID-19 faster. Researchers and medical practitioners worldwide have explored the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, in few occasions combined with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, for COVID-19 treatment. These two drugs are economic and easily available, and hence gained attention as a potential option for COVID-19 management. As per the available evidence, the outcomes of treatments with these medications are conflicting from both the efficacy and safety (predominantly cardiac related) perspectives. Currently, multiple studies are underway to test the safety and efficacy of these medications and more results are expected in the near future. The retina, the endocrine system (with risk of hypoglycemia), the musculoskeletal system, the hematological system, and the neurological system may also be affected. The use of these drugs is contraindicated in patients with arrhythmias, known hypersensitivity, and in patients on amiodarone. In addition to the published literature, personal communication with doctors treating COVID-19 patients seems to suggest the drugs may be effective in reducing symptoms and hastening clinical recovery. The literature evidence is still equivocal and further results are awaited. There has been recent controversy including retraction of articles published in prestigious journals about these medicines. Their low cost, long history of use, and easy availability are positive factors with regard to use of these drugs in COVID-19. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

However, COVID-19 restrictions required people to spend more time at home so the exposure to air pollutants shifted to being derived from that of domestic interiors, rather than outdoors or the workplace environment. This study aims to characterise the influence of lockdown intervention on the balance of indoor and outdoor PM2.5 exposure in a Malaysian suburb. We also calculate the potential health risk from exposure to both indoor and outdoor PM2.5 to give context to personal exposure assessment in different microenvironments during the COVID-19 lockdown, known locally as Movement Control Orders (MCO). The implementation of the MCOs slightly reduced daily average of outdoor PM2.5 concentrations (median of 12.63 µg m–3 before and 11.72 µg m–3). In the Malaysian apartment considered here, cooking led to a substantial increase in exposure from increasing concentrations in PM2.5 during a COVID-19 lockdown (maximum average concentration at 52.2 µg m–3). The estimated excess risk to health was about 25% for lung cancer from staying indoor. Thus, there seems a potential for greater exposure to fine particles indoors under lockdown, so it is likely premature to suggest that more lives were saved through a reduction of outdoor pollutants than lost in the pandemic. Unfortunately, little is known about the toxicity of indoor particles and the types of exposures that result where people increase the amount of time they spend working from home or staying indoors, especially during periods of lockdown. © The Author(s).","Cancer; Cardio-respiratory diseases; Cooking; Indoor air quality; Lockdown","Pollution; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Viruses; Average concentration; Indoor particles; Microenvironments; Outdoor exposure; Personal exposure assessments; PM2.5 concentration; Potential health risks; Workplace environments; Health risks; cancer; COVID-19; health risk; indoor air; particulate matter; pollution exposure; suburban area; workplace; Malaysia"

To date, almost two million cases and over 100,000 deaths from the disease caused by this virus were reported worldwide. The environmental and meteorological factors are claimed to stimulate the spread of the virus in which the transmissibility in terms of climatic fluctuations increases exponentially with high humidity and low temperature. In an attempt to understand this epidemic, there is a need to investigate the factors that could impact the spread and death of COVID-19. We, therefore, proposed to investigate global geographical climate impacts on the COVID-19 spread and death in Asia and America. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a network that seeks to replicate neuronal functionality in the human brain. It is the preferred instrument for several predictive applications of data mining, due to its strength, versatility, and simplicity.

The study proposes that psychological well-being (PWB) and depression mediate the relationship between COVID-19 SMN, WB and TP. Design/methodology/approach: The data for this research was collected from white-collar employees of two Asian countries, Pakistan (study 1, n = 167) and Malaysia (study 2, n = 118), was collected using an online survey during strict movement control order (MCO), work from home, at the beginning of the year 2020. Findings: In both studies, the PWB of employees mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and their WB. On the other hand, depression only mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and WB in Pakistan. PWB only mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and TP in study 2. Depression only mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and TP in study 1. Research limitations/implications: A couple of limitations worth noting are that the study adopted a cross-sectional approach. Thus, the sample size is not large in both counties. Because of the outbreak, limited employees agree to be part of an online survey. The scope of the study also restricts the authors to collect data during MCO, when employees were forced to work from home. In Pakistan, MCO began on 20th March and ended on 30th April, while in Malaysia, MCO started on 18th March and ended on 12th May. This also limits the study's claim of generalizability. Practical implications: The practical implication of the study is to guide practitioners of both Pakistan and Malaysia in developing strategies that help them understand that employees having PWB look for growth and challenging opportunities even during pandemic situations; employers can leverage it to deal with external threats like COVID-19 because improving the PWB can improve TP and reduce WB. The interesting results highlighted the fact that high TP not necessarily means everything is fine with employees, when the uncertainty level is high, employees may be performing well due to fear and depression instead of work motivation. Thus, employers should be more vigilant during a pandemic situation. This study also helps policymakers understand that the overall economic situation affects the individual employee’s state of mind and work behavior. Originality/value: The paper contributes to scare literature on COVID-19 and SMN and illustrates employees' work behavior when forced to work from home during the MCO. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19 social media news; Depression; Psychological well-being; Task performance; Work from home; Work-related boredom",

However, the effectiveness of online learning is remains unanswered. Besides, online learning may have a significant impact if continued in the upcoming academic sessions. Therefore, the core of this study is to predict the academic performance of undergraduate students at one of the public universities in Malaysia by using Recurrent Forecasting-Singular Spectrum Analysis (RF-SSA) and Vector Forecasting-Singular Spectrum Analysis (VF-SSA). The key concept of the predictive model is to improve the efficiency of different types of forecast model in SSA by using two parameters which are window length (L) and number of leading components (r). The forecasting approaches in SSA model was based on the Grading Point Assessments (GPA) for undergraduate students from Faculty Science and Mathematics, UPSI via online classes during COVID-19 outbreak. The experiment revealed that parameter L= 11 (T/20) has the best prediction result for RF-SSA model with RMSE value of 0.19 as compared to VF-SSA of 0.30. This signifies the competency of RF-SSA in predicting the students’ academic performances based on GPA for the upcoming semester.

Notably, these impacts are occurring in the context of other anthropogenic-driven threats including global climate change. Both anthropogenic stressors and the COVID-19 pandemic represent significant economic challenges to aquaculture systems across the globe, threatening the supply chain of one of the most important sources of animal protein, with potential disproportionate impacts on vulnerable communities. A web survey was conducted in 47 countries in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess how aquaculture activities have been affected by the pandemic, and to explore how these impacts compare to those from climate change. A positive correlation between the effects of the two categories of drivers was detected, but analysis suggests that the pandemic and the anthropogenic stressors affect different parts of the supply chain. The immediate measurable reported losses varied with aquaculture typology (land vs. marine, and intensive vs. extensive). A comparably lower impact on farmers reporting the use of integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) methods suggests that IMTA might enhance resilience to multiple stressors by providing different market options under the COVID-19 pandemic. Results emphasize the importance of assessing detrimental effects of COVID-19 under a multiple stressor lens, focusing on areas that have already locally experienced economic loss due to anthropogenic stressors in the last decade. Holistic policies that simultaneously address other ongoing anthropogenic stressors, rather than focusing solely on the acute impacts of COVID-19, are needed to maximize the long-term resilience of the aquaculture sector. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, requirement for insulin during hospitalization for COVID-19 may be a marker of poor prognosis and as such could be used to identify patient population who require more aggressive treatments to prevent mortality. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","COVID-19; diabetes; HbA1c; insulin; mortality","erythropoietin; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; metformin; insulin; chronic kidney failure; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; end stage renal disease; estimated glomerular filtration rate; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; insulin treatment; iron deficiency anemia; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; priority journal; Review; diabetes mellitus; hospitalization; COVID-19; Diabetes Mellitus; Hospitalization; Humans; Insulin; SARS-CoV-2"

Hence, this study intends to explore the Gen Z perception of gamified health awareness campaigns. In total, 170 Gen Z was involved in this study. The present study applied standard descriptive statistical methods for analyzing the data. The findings showed the need for a gamification approach for a health awareness campaign to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic among Gen Z.

All activities carried out at a university are different from the secondary and primary levels because all student activities at the university are carried out by the students themselves under the purview of the Student Affairs Division UiTM Melaka Branch (UiTMCM). There are a few processes and problems that students may experience along the way in proposing their activities. In addition, the COVID -19 pandemic situation is aggravating the approval procedures, as the Malaysian government has so far enforced the Movement Control Order (MCO), which started on March 18, 2020. During this period, all citizens must stay at home, and practices of social distancing are constantly enforced. Hence, most of the time was spent on the Internet for their work and some other purposes. These problems can be solved if there is a system developed as a proof of concept derived from standard visualization of analysis model using a common development methodology that can supports approval processes, that does not require physical meetings and standardization of the application format, and that can also provide the information about the availability of dates for reservation for the activity, as well as information management for better utilization of the budget. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

Design/methodology/approach: The study is designed using a causal research design to examine the cause-effect relationship between the study variables. The study sample consists of 595 school teachers selected via convenient sampling. Quantitative data are collected from an online survey through the questionnaires with demographic, stress, e-evaluation and work motivation developed by the researchers were distributed during the MCO period. To test the model, structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied by using AMOS 21. Findings: The results indicated that the e-evaluation, stress and work motivation of teachers during the MCO were conducted at a moderate level. The stress relationship with work motivation of teachers was also weak and showed a negative relationship, while e-evaluation and work motivation showed a strong relationship. The results of the SEM analysis revealed that the model fit was achieved with RMSEA = 0.07, GFI = 0.96, CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.97, ChiSq/df = 4.30 and p = 0.00. In addition, there was no role of stress as a mediator in the relationship between e-evaluation and work motivation and e-evaluation contributed 54% to work motivation. Research limitations/implications: This study underlines our contention that teachers’ work motivation correlated positively with their e-evaluation. The findings suggest that teachers’ stress cannot mediate the relationship between e-evaluation and work motivation. The limitations of the study include the convenience sampling, non-probability sampling technique, not chosen at random and undermines the generalizations from sample to the population. Practical implications: The results provide a useful framework to teachers for the successful implementation of e-evaluations in their instruction to enhance their work-motivation. Originality/value: There is a lack of e-evaluation studies in teacher education and teaching strategies, and the correlation between e-evaluation and work motivation during COVID-19 pandemic is often absent. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-evaluation; Motivation; Pandemic pedagogy; Stress; Teaching online",

Design/methodology/approach: Monthly HPIs and consumer price index (CPI) data ranges from 2010M1 to 2020M5 are used. This study uses a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model for empirical analysis. Findings: The findings of this study reveal that the Covid-19 pandemic exerted both long-run and short-run asymmetric relationship on HPI of Turkey while in Kazakhstan, the long-run impact of Covid-19 pandemic shock is symmetrical long-run positive effect is similar in both HPI markets. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of this study are the study scope and data set due to data constraint. Several other macroeconomic variables may affect housing prices; however, variables used in this study satisfy the focus of this study in the presence of data constraint. HPI and CPI variables were made available on monthly basis for a considerably longer period which guaranteed the ranges of data set used in this study.

MCO was introduced in March 2020, and the learning process switched from face-to-face to online learning in schools and universities. Subsequently, with the reduced number of daily cases and active cases of COVID-19, the Malaysian Government implemented RMCO from 10th June to 31st December 2020, which had more relaxation of restrictions. This study particularly focuses on students studying in higher education institutions by analysing the impacts of the community of inquiry on students learning performance. The construct of the community of inquiry includes social presence, cognitive presence and teaching presence. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides quantitative analysis, independent sample t-tests and multiple linear regression on the students’ learning performance using the framework of community of inquiry. This paper presents the analysis of the online learning preference of 282 university students during MCO and 456 students during RMCO. Findings: The results showed that there is a significant difference in students learning process during MCO and RMCO. The findings also indicated that the social presence is the most important factor in affecting learning performance during the MCO period and it changed to teaching presence during RMCO. Students lost motivation and could not perform well using online learning methods during the MCO period but the situation improved during RMCO. Research limitations/implications: This research helps to identify the impact of the pandemic on higher education and provides insights into reshaping the future of higher education system. Practical implications: Students are isolated from their peers in the learning process and struggle to adapt to the new normal in online learning. The teaching faculties are picking up new skills to deliver online courses and manage the risk as best as they can. This study presented the impact of the pandemic on students learning performance and explored the space for universities as business organizations to provide better infrastructures and platforms for online learning while battling with cash flow and debt level during this challenging time. Social implications: Students need peer support and guidance from the faculty team in their learning journey. The study provides a better understanding of how we shall promote a better higher education environment, either blended or online learning. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of the community of inquiry on students learning performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students suffered during the MCO period and the learning experience got better when they were able to adapt to the changes. The higher education system needs a reform and the agency theory in corporate governance plays an important role in the transformation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agency theory; Blended and online learning; COVID-19; Performance; Teaching and learning",

This qualitative narrative review involved an analysis of various types of publications including scholarly articles, world organizations’ reports, university documents as well as commentaries and reports from mainstream news outlets and social media that directly focus on the topic. It is evident from the review that Malaysian HEIs’ priority was in safeguarding student and staff welfare in terms of their health and safety. While providing emergency aid to students and support for institutions, the Ministry of Higher Education together with HEIs developed administrative measures to safeguard the delivery of programmes through remote online learning. The analysis confirmed that while online learning is considered appropriate during an emergency period, the digital divide clearly still exists, posing the greatest challenge to Malaysia’s recovery post COVID-19.

This article explores the multi-faceted COVID-19 responses of three countries in Southeast Asia–Malaysia, Myanmar and Singapore–countries who share a common history of British colonisation. This article explores the three countries’ overall responses to the pandemic, highlighting shared challenges and divergences based on their respective experiences: Singapore as an advanced, highly urbanised city-state; Malaysia as an advanced developing country; and Myanmar as a lower-resourced developing country. © 2021 The Round Table Ltd.","COVID-19; health systems; Malaysia; Myanmar; Singapore; Southeast Asia","colonization; COVID-19; health status; population dynamics; public health; urban area; China; Malaysia; Myanmar; Singapore [Southeast Asia]"
"How Are Destination Image and Travel Intention Influenced by Misleading Media Coverage?

Due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan city, China has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization. Since then, the widespread disease has filled major international media channels. However, a large proportion of media coverage surrounding COVID-19 has negatively affected China’s destination image and potential visitors’ travel intentions due to headlines such as ‘Chinese virus pandemonium’. Such language may diminish tourists’ intentions to visit China and tarnish the country’s image. By proposing an image model, we delineate a direct association between China’s country image, destination image, and travel intention in this article. We further consider misleading media coverage as a moderating role in this relationship. Academic and practical implications are also discussed based on the proposed framework. © 2021 Management Development Institute.","Country Image; COVID-19 Outbreak; Destination Image; Misleading Media Coverage; Travel Intention",

This research used a sample of 188 non-financial firms from the Malaysian market for the years 2019-2020. We found that the COVID-19 has affected all firm characteristics including firm performance, governance structure, dividend, liquidity, and leverage level, yet, the difference between prior and post COVID-19 pandemic is not significant. Also, the investigation revealed that board size exerts a significant positive impact on firm performance. After splitting the sample based on year, however, we found that board size does not matter in the uncertain time of the current crisis, while board diversity appeared to be significantly enhancing firm performance in the crisis time compared to the prior year where it has an inverse association with firm performance in both indicators. Board meetings and audit committee meetings seemed to have a significant negative influence on firm performance pre and post-COVID-19. This study contributes to the limited literature by providing the first empirical evidence on the impact of Coronavirus on the firm performance and corporate governance association. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","Audit Committee; Corporate Governance; COVID-19; Firm Performance; Malaysia",

This study investigates the association between physical-activity levels and sleep patterns in quarantined individuals. An international Google online survey was launched in April 6th, 2020 for 12-weeks. Forty-one research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western-Asia, and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, which was made available in 14 languages. The survey was presented in a differential format with questions related to responses “before” and “during” the confinement period. Participants responded to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire and the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. 5056 replies (59.4% female), from Europe (46.4%), Western-Asia (25.4%), America (14.8%) and North-Africa (13.3%) were analysed. The COVID-19 home confinement led to impaired sleep quality, as evidenced by the increase in the global PSQI score (4.37 ± 2.71 before home confinement vs. 5.32 ± 3.23 during home confinement) (p &lt; 0.001). The frequency of individuals experiencing a good sleep decreased from 61% (n = 3063) before home confinement to 48% (n = 2405) during home confinement with highly active individuals experienced better sleep quality (p &lt; 0.001) in both conditions. Time spent engaged in all physical-activity and the metabolic equivalent of task in each physical-activity category (i.e., vigorous, moderate, walking) decreased significantly during COVID-19 home confinement (p &lt; 0.001). The number of hours of daily-sitting increased by ~2 hours/days during home confinement (p &lt; 0.001). COVID-19 home confinement resulted in significantly negative alterations in sleep patterns and physical-activity levels. To maintain health during home confinement, physical-activity promotion and sleep hygiene education and support are strongly warranted. © 2021 Institute of Sport.

However, as the Dutch disease emerged in the 1970s, innumerable researchers were attracted to investigate the negative impact of abundant natural resources on economic growth. The issue has been rigorously discussed in a large number of previous studies. However, they did not investigate the effect of economic growth on natural resource abundance. Therefore, this study embarks on an investigation into the effect of economic growth on natural resource abundance in selected ASEAN countries, namely Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia. This study employs the static panel method to analyse data ranging from 2000 to 2016. The results show that foreign direct investment and direct investment can have negative impacts on natural resource abundance. An increase in economic growth, on the other hand, can have a positive impact of natural resource abundance. Other factors such as financial development, trade openness and governance do not influence natural resource abundance. Therefore, these findings can shed light for policymakers to formulate policies for future references as the outcomes based on before the spread of Covid-19 diseases. The countries can enhance economic growth to pave the way for more exploration of natural resources. Higher economic growth can lead to more advanced technologies and thus it is easy to extract more natural resources. Foreign direct investment and direct investment should be controlled to ensure that natural resources will not be exhausted. © 2021, Econjournals.

Bound test was applied to examine the long-run and short-run relationships based on the sample period beginning from 1970 until 2016. The results confirmed the existence of a long-run relationship between the variables. Financial development in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand had successfully reduced income inequality, however, a different effect was recorded in the Philippines where income distribution was worsened. Furthermore, economic growth brought positive effect to income distribution in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not for Thailand and the Philippines. Inflation, trade openness and foreign direct investment, provided mixed results for all countries. Among the policies recommendation for this paper are there should be more easy accessibility for entrepreneurs to reach the wide range of financial services including conventional and Islamic financial products, the expansion of capital market, as well as giving proper attention to the financial sector. Besides, granting the access to capital markets for low income groups or underprivileged individuals might be helpful to them either by developing entrepreneurial skill or involvement in productive activities and receive better salaries.

False news, conspiracy theories, and magical cures were shared with the general public at an alarming rate, which may lead to increased anxiety and stress levels and associated debilitating consequences. Objectives: To measure the level of COVID-19 information overload (COVIO) and assess the association between COVIO and sociodemographic characteristics among the general public. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between April and May 2020 using a modified Cancer Information Overload scale. The survey was developed and posted on four social media platforms. The data were only collected from those who consented to participate. COVIO score was classified into high vs. low using the asymmetrical distribution as a guide and conducted a binary logistic regression to examine the factors associated with COVIO. Results: A total number of 584 respondents participated in this study. The mean COVIO score of the respondents was 19.4 (± 4.0). Sources and frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were found to be significant predictors of COVIO. Participants who received information via the broadcast media were more likely to have high COVIO than those who received information via the social media (adjusted odds ratio ([aOR],14.599; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.608–132.559; p = 0.017). Also, participants who received COVID-19 information every minute (aOR, 3.892; 95% CI, 1.124–13.480; p = 0.032) were more likely to have high COVIO than those who received information every week. Conclusion: The source of information and the frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were significantly associated with COVIO. The COVID-19 information is often conflicting, leading to confusion and overload of information in the general population. This can have unfavorable effects on the measures taken to control the transmission and management of COVID-19 infection. © 2021, W.

The burden of disease among healthcare workers (HCW) has not been well studied despite reports of infectivity and transmission around the world. Two HCW in Hospital Teluk Intan (HTI) contracted COVID-19 while attending a social event. They were in close proximity with colleagues upon returning to work, resulting in the spread of infection among other HCW in HTI. Objective: The objectives of this paper are to gain a better understanding of the key presenting symptoms of COVID-19 in HCWs in a district specialist hospital, to establish the proportion of symptomatic COVID-19 cases among HCWs and its severity and to determine the time taken from onset of symptoms or perceived exposure to diagnostic testing. Methodology: This is a retrospective descriptive analysis of clinical characteristics of subjects infected with COVID-19 among HCW in HTI. Their demography and clinical characteristics were recorded. Results: There were 47 HCW in HTI who tested positive for COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 37.5 years old. 7 patients (15.2%) had at least more than one comorbidity. Average duration of time from perceived close contact to onset of symptom was 4.5 days, while the mean duration of time from symptoms to first positive RT-PCR result was 3.4 days. Six patients (13.0%) were asymptomatic throughout, whereas 40 (87.0%) had at least one symptom prior to hospitalization. The most commonly reported symptoms were fever (65.2%), sore throat (39.1%) and cough (37.0%). In terms of severity of symptoms, the majority of patients experienced mild symptoms (Group 2, 52.2%). Two patients (4.3%) with multiple comorbidities had severe disease requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. There were no mortalities, and the longest staying patient was hospitalized for 18 days. The high rates of infectivity among HCW in HTI can be attributed to working in close proximity while in the asymptomatic incubation phase, while no HCW directly involved in the care of COVID-19 positive patients were tested positive. Conclusion: We report that HCW share similar clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection as those of non HCW patients in earlier studies. The infection can spread rapidly within healthcare settings via close contacts among infected HCWs. As such, we advocate distancing when working and usage of personal protective equipment when treating patients with respiratory illness to reduce transmission of COVID-19. © 2021, Malaysian Medical Association.

Findings: The findings showed no significant difference in terms of the psychological impact of COVID-19 among students according to the variables, nationality (local and international), gender and level of study. The descriptive analysis showed that the outbreak of COVID-19 made the students anxious, worried and restless. Besides, the outbreak of COVID-19 made the students unable to focus on their study, feel anxious about studying, have less confidence on their leaning and commit more mistakes than normal days.

Successful management in times of crisis ensures business continuity and institutional survival, making preparedness preceding an impending pandemic essential. Institutions of higher education (IHEs) must maintain balance between academic continuity and preventing morbidity during a pandemic crisis. To date, however, no general pandemic preparedness frameworks exist for IHEs. The aim of this paper is to report on the development of a Haddon matrix framework for IHE pandemic preparedness based on a scoping literature review of past IHE responses including pre-, during and post-pandemic phases. First, a review of previous global responses by IHEs during past pandemics was carried out. The review findings were then collated into a new IHE-centric Haddon matrix for pandemic preparedness. The content of the matrix is then illustrated through the documented responses of Malaysian universities during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

By the 20 January 2021, the cumulative numbers reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 had reached 169,379 including 630 deaths. Malaysia has been hit by three waves of COVID-19. This article reports on the three waves, the current situation and some of the possible factors associated. It outlines the need to reassess the overall situation, re-strategize the approach in order to contain the spread. The first COVID-19 wave lasted from 25 January to 16 February 2020, the second wave occurred between the 27 February 2020 and the 30 June 2020. The current third wave began on 8th September 2020.The sudden surge of cases in the third wave was mainly due to the two largest contributors, namely the Benteng Lahad Datu cluster in Sabah state and Kedah's Tembok cluster. The current situation is critical. The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 continue to soar. The challengers faced by healthcare workers and other front liners is tremendous. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer are the leading cause of death in Malaysia. A paradigm shift in the approach is required to ensure the sustainability of the normal healthcare services provided by the government especially for the lower income groups.

The study aims at determining the effect of the current coronavirus epidemic in the form of stress perceived among the medical workers in Pakistan and to discover the moderating role played by a healthy climate in offsetting it. The data was collected from 255 medical workers through a self-administered online questionnaire. Multiple Hierarchical Regression was used as a tool to test the hypotheses of the study. The results obtained indicate a correlation between the pandemic and the stress caused by it among the health workers, whereas, the role of a wholesome climate in the reduction of stress among them was found lacking. Sub-hypotheses indicate that the healthy environment provided by supervisors is effective in reducing the impact of workers’ handling of the Covid-19 epidemic and perceived stress, while the healthy environment provided by hospitals in general or by workgroups fails to cause such positive change. This revelation necessitates the adoption of compulsory precautionary measures on the part of relevant authorities, because increase in stress caused by the pandemic can prove more lethal than the pandemic itself.

Besides, negative indirect impacts also exist, such as the rise in waste level and curtailment in recycling, further threatening the physical spaces (land and water), besides air. It is expected that global businesses will revive in the near future (though slowly), but the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions during this short time span is not a sustainable way of environmental mitigation. Thus, long-term mitigation policies should be strengthened to cope with the undesirable deterioration of the environment.

This article investigates whether the size of the tourism sector influences the economic policy response to COVID-19 pandemic using data from 136 countries. The findings show that the larger the tourism sector, the larger the economic stimulus package introduced by governments globally. Furthermore, we find that the size of the tourism sector is positively associated with both fiscal and monetary policy responses to the pandemic.

Almost the whole world, at some point of time, was placed in lock-down in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, with resulting psychological and economic sequela. As countries start to ease lock-down measures and reopen industries, ensuring a healthy workplace for employees has become imperative. Thus, this paper presents a mobile app-based intelligent portable healthcare (pHealth) tool, called {i} WorkSafe, to assist industries in detecting possible suspects for COVID-19 infection among their employees who may need primary care. Developed mainly for low-end Android devices, the {i} WorkSafe app hosts a fuzzy neural network model that integrates data of employees' health status from the industry's database, proximity and contact tracing data from the mobile devices, and user-reported COVID-19 self-test data. Using the built-in Bluetooth low energy sensing technology and K Nearest Neighbor and K-means techniques, the app is capable of tracking users' proximity and trace contact with other employees. Additionally, it uses a logistic regression model to calculate the COVID-19 self-test score and a Bayesian Decision Tree model for checking real-time health condition from an intelligent e-health platform for further clinical attention of the employees. Rolled out in an apparel factory on 12 employees as a test case, the pHealth tool generates an alert to maintain social distancing among employees inside the industry. In addition, the app helps employees to estimate risk with possible COVID-19 infection based on the collected data and found that the score is effective in estimating personal health condition of the app user. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; Coronavirus; digital health; Industry 4.0; machine learning; mobile app; safe workplace; worker safety","Computer viruses; Decision trees; Fuzzy neural networks; Health risks; Locks (fasteners); Logistic regression; mHealth; Nearest neighbor search; Risk perception; Statistical tests; Viruses; Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Contact-tracing data; Fuzzy neural network model; High transmission rate; Industrial settings; K-nearest neighbors; Logistic Regression modeling; Sensing technology; Personnel"

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for its pathogenesis. The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Initially, it was thought to be limited to the respiratory system; however, we now recognize that COVID-19 also affects several other organs, including the nervous system. Two similar human coronaviruses (CoV) that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) are also known to cause disease in the nervous system. The neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are growing rapidly, as evidenced by several reports. There are several mechanisms responsible for such manifestations in the nervous system. For instance, post-infectious immune-mediated processes, direct virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), and virus-induced hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states are commonly involved. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variants, dysfunction of taste and smell, and muscle injury are numerous examples of COVID-19 PNS (peripheral nervous system) disease. Likewise, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, encephalitis, meningitis, encephalopathy acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, endothelialitis, and venous sinus thrombosis are some instances of COVID-19 CNS disease. Due to multifactorial and complicated pathogenic mechanisms, COVID-19 poses a large-scale threat to the whole nervous system. A complete understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neurological impairments is still lacking, but our knowledge base is rapidly expanding. Therefore, we anticipate that this comprehensive review will provide valuable insights and facilitate the work of neuroscientists in unfolding different neurological dimensions of COVID-19 and other CoV associated abnormalities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","ACE2; Cerebrovascular disease; Coronavirus (CoV); COVID-19; Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS); Multiple sclerosis; Nervous system; Neuropathogenesis; SARS-CoV-2",

Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) remains the primary means for diagnosing the new virus strain but it is time consuming and costly. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal amplification assay that does not require a PCR machine. It is an affordable, rapid, and simple assay. In this study, we developed and optimized a sensitive reverse transcription (RT)-RPA assay for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 using SYBR Green I and/or lateral flow (LF) strip. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the RT-RPA assay were tested by using 10-fold serial diluted synthetic RNA and genomic RNA of similar viruses, respectively. Clinical sensitivity and specificity of the RT-RPA assay were carried out using 78 positive and 35 negative nasopharyngeal samples. The detection limit of both RPA and RT-qPCR assays was 7.659 and 5 copies/μL RNA, respectively with no cross reactivity with other viruses. The clinical sensitivity and specificity of RT-RPA were 98% and 100%, respectively.

Pandemics observed through the years have not only presented a medical challenge but also had a large impact on the psychological well-being of society. Overcoming these challenges required a strategically structured response on the medical and social front. To achieve the said goal on the social front, it is necessary to understand the cognitive appraisal and response of the public during this stressful environment. The restricted movement control used to curb the further spread of the disease drastically hampered tourism in Malaysia. This study aims to follow a statistical analysis based on the cognitive appraisal theory to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the public residing in Penang Island which is one of the most famous tourist destinations in the world. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional, observational study design was carried out for this research. Snowball sampling technique was used and the data was collected via a semi-structured online questionnaire measuring the psychological health of people present in Penang Island. Findings: The study reports a positive response in terms of disease awareness and proper observation of preventive measures, yet a high level of pandemic induced anxiety was statistically estimated.

A systematic literature review on educational robotics (ER) keywords between 2015–2020 was carried out for the purpose to review a total of 2253 articles from the selected sources; Scopus (452), Taylor & Francis (311), Science Direct (427), IEEE Xplore (221), and Web of Science (842). This review procedure was labelled as Taxonomy 1. After filtering Taxonomy 1, it was found that 98 scientific articles formed the so-called Taxonomy II that was categorized into six categories: (i) Robotics concepts, (ii) Device, (iii) Robotic applications, (iv) Manufacturing robots, (v) Robotics analysis, and (vi) Education/taxonomy. For this study, only 35 articles in this specific field were selected, of which were then assigned into three categories: (i) Application, (ii) Platform, and (iii) Educational. The results show that the application category carries 17.4%, platform 20%, and education 22.85%. This study serves as the application platform to help students, academics, and researchers. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

COVID-19 spreading through person-to-person transmission routes including direct transmission, like cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation and contact transmission, like contact with oral, nasal and eye mucous membranes. The operators in oral health care profession expose to great risk of COVID-19 infection due to face-to-face communication and their exposure to fluids from the conjunctiva, oral cavity, nose and also other body fluids, and handling with the sharp instruments. Oral health care professionals (dentists and dental hygien-ists) play a prime role in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Several dental hospitals and clinics have been completely closed or have been providing minimal treatment for emergency cases. However, prophylactic and emergency treatments are being provided in some countries and a few supporting regular dental treatment. Oral health practitioners are prone to risk as they are hardly prepared for such unexpected global outbreak. Lack of universal protocol or guidelines to control the infection and dental care provision during such a pandemic condition could be of better help. The present study fills in the missing gap with necessary recommendations comprising of preventive steps for disease/infection transmission during dental practice to block the operator-to-patient and vice-versa transmission routes in dental clinics and hospitals. © 2021, Radiance Research Academy.

Drawing on this broader notion of Tibbin Nabawi, this paper addresses a critical question of how the ""healthy lifestyle"" prescribed in Islamic tradition provides a preventive measure against potentially fatal diseases and deadly viruses such as COVID-19. For this, the essay examines Islamic perspective on, among other things, ?aharah (cleanliness), food habit and dieting, sleep and rest cycle, and pandemics. It argues that Islamic traditions on healthy lifestyle, which is largely consistent with the prescriptions of modern science, offer a unique physical and spiritual paradigm to fight toxic diseases of the human body and pandemics such as COVID-19. © 2020 International Islamic University Malaysia.

The biological structure and symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral chest maladies, which makes it challenging and a big issue to improve approaches for efficient identification of COVID-19 disease. In this study, an automatic prediction of COVID-19 identification is proposed to automatically discriminate between healthy and COVID-19 infected subjects in X-ray images using two successful moderns are traditional machine learning methods (e.g., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), linear kernel and radial basis function (RBF), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Decision Tree (DT), and CN 2 rule inducer techniques) and deep learning models (e.g., MobileNets V2, ResNet50, GoogleNet, DarkNet and Xception). A large X-ray dataset has been created and developed, namely the COVID-19 vs. Normal (400 healthy cases, and 400 COVID cases). To the best of our knowledge, it is currently the largest publicly accessible COVID-19 dataset with the largest number of X-ray images of confirmed COVID-19 infection cases. Based on the results obtained from the experiments, it can be concluded that all the models performed well, deep learning models had achieved the optimum accuracy of 98.8% in ResNet50 model.

Furthermore, we develop a model with suitable optimal control strategies. Our aim is to minimize the infection in the host population. In order to do this, we use two control variables. Moreover, sensitivity analysis complemented by simulations are performed to determine how changes in parameters affect the dynamical behavior of the system. Taking into account the central manifold theory the bifurcation analysis is also incorporated.

This study aimed to determine whether COVID-19–free surgical pathways were associated with lower postoperative pulmonary complication rates compared with hospitals with no defined pathway. PATIENTS AND METHODS This international, multicenter cohort study included patients who underwent elective surgery for 10 solid cancer types without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Participating hospitals included patients from local emergence of SARS-CoV-2 until April 19, 2020. At the time of surgery, hospitals were defined as having a COVID-19–free surgical pathway (complete segregation of the operating theater, critical care, and inpatient ward areas) or no defined pathway (incomplete or no segregation, areas shared with patients with COVID-19). The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, unexpected ventilation). RESULTS Of 9,171 patients from 447 hospitals in 55 countries, 2,481 were operated on in COVID-19–free surgical pathways. Patients who underwent surgery within COVID-19–free surgical pathways were younger with fewer comorbidities than those in hospitals with no defined pathway but with similar proportions of major surgery. After adjustment, pulmonary complication rates were lower with COVID-19–free surgical pathways (2.2% v 4.9%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.86). This was consistent in sensitivity analyses for low-risk patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 1/2), propensity score–matched models, and patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 preoperative tests. The postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was also lower in COVID-19–free surgical pathways (2.1% v 3.6%; aOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.76). CONCLUSION Within available resources, dedicated COVID-19–free surgical pathways should be established to provide safe elective cancer surgery during current and before future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

Swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in areas with a high 14-day SARS-CoV-2 case notification rate, but not before minor surgery or in low-risk areas. To prevent one pulmonary complication, the number needed to swab test before major or minor surgery was 18 and 48 respectively in high-risk areas, and 73 and 387 in low-risk areas. Conclusion: Preoperative nasopharyngeal swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in high SARS-CoV-2 risk areas. There was no proven benefit of swab testing before minor surgery in low-risk areas. © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of BJS Society Ltd.

Description: COVID-19 directly affects pregnant women causing more severe disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The indirect effects due to the monumental COVID-19 response are much worse, increasing maternal and neonatal mortality. Assessment: Amidst COVID-19, governments must balance effective COVID-19 response measures while continuing delivery of essential health services. Using the World Health Organization’s operational guidelines as a base, countries must conduct contextualized analyses to tailor their operations. Evidence based information on different services and comparative cost-benefits will help decisions on trade-offs. Situational analyses identifying extent and reasons for service disruptions and estimates of impacts using modelling techniques will guide prioritization of services. Ensuring adequate supplies, maintaining core interventions, expanding non-physician workforce and deploying telehealth are some adaptive measures to optimize care. Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, governments must reinvest in maternal and child health by building more resilient maternal health services supported by political commitmentand multisectoral engagement, and with assistance from international partners. Conclusions: Multi-sectoral investments providing high-quality care that ensures continuity and available to all segments of the population are needed. A robust primary healthcare system linked to specialist care and accessible to all segments of the population including marginalized subgroups is of paramount importance. Systematic approaches to digital health care solutions to bridge gaps in service is imperative. Future pandemic preparedness programs must include action plans for resilient maternal health services. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Covid 19; Maternal and child health; Pandemic; Pregnant women; Preparedness","adult; developing country; epidemiology; female; human; maternal health service; mortality; mother; organization and management; pandemic; poverty; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; psychology; Adult; COVID-19; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Maternal Health Services; Mothers; Pandemics; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Pregnant Women; SARS-CoV-2"

Particularists try their best to tackle this global crisis. New challenges outlined from various medical perspectives may require a novel design solution. Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers show different health conditions and no symptoms; hence, a differentiation process is required to avert the risk of chronic virus carriers. Objectives: Laboratory criteria and patient dataset are compulsory in constructing a new framework. Prioritisation is a popular topic and a complex issue for patients with COVID-19, especially for asymptomatic carriers due to multi-laboratory criteria, criterion importance and trade-off amongst these criteria. This study presents new integrated decision-making framework that handles the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19 and can detect the health conditions of asymptomatic carriers. Methods: The methodology includes four phases. Firstly, eight important laboratory criteria are chosen using two feature selection approaches. Real and simulation datasets from various medical perspectives are integrated to produce a new dataset involving 56 patients with different health conditions and can be used to check asymptomatic cases that can be detected within the prioritisation configuration. The first phase aims to develop a new decision matrix depending on the intersection between ‘multi-laboratory criteria’ and ‘COVID-19 patient list’. In the second phase, entropy is utilised to set the objective weight, and TOPSIS is adapted to prioritise patients in the third phase. Finally, objective validation is performed. Results: The patients are prioritised based on the selected criteria in descending order of health situation starting from the worst to the best. The proposed framework can discriminate among mild, serious and critical conditions and put patients in a queue while considering asymptomatic carriers. Validation findings revealed that the patients are classified into four equal groups and showed significant differences in their scores, indicating the validity of ranking. Conclusions: This study implies and discusses the numerous benefits of the suggested framework in detecting/recognising the health condition of patients prior to discharge, supporting the hospitalisation characteristics, managing patient care and optimising clinical prediction rule. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Entropy; Laboratory characteristics; Multi-criteria decision making; Prioritisation; Respiratory; TOPSIS","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Entropy; Health; Health risks; Viruses; Critical condition; Decision matrices; Differentiation process; Health condition; Integrated decision makings; Objective weight; Prediction rules; TOPSIS method; Laboratories; Article; artificial intelligence; asymptomatic carrier; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; entropy; feature selection; feature selection algorithm; human; methodology; priority journal; validity; adult; aged; computer simulation; decision support system; diagnostic procedure; female; heterozygote; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; reproducibility; risk factor; time factor; Adult; Aged; Carrier State; Computer Simulation; COVID-19; Decision Support Techniques; Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Time Factors"

We undertook a systematic literature review and comprehensive analysis of a total of 55 articles on arterial and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 and articles on previous pandemics with respect to thromboembolism and compared the similarities and differences between them. The presence of thrombosis in multiple organ systems points to thromboembolism being an integral component in the pathogenesis of this disease. Thromboembolism is likely to be the main player in the morbidity and mortality of COVID -19 in which the pulmonary system is most severely affected. We also hypothesize that D-dimer values could be used as an early marker for prognostication of disease as it has been seen to be raised even in the pre-symptomatic stage. This further strengthens the notion that thromboembolism prevention is necessary. We also examined literature on the neurovascular and cardiovascular systems, as the manifestation of thromboembolic phenomenon in these two systems varied, suggesting different pathophysiology of damage.

This article aims to discuss the pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of diabetes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Areas covered: We discussed various aspects of pharmacotherapeutic management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: (i) susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 among individuals with diabetes, (ii) glycemic goals for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes, (iii) pharmacological treatment considerations for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes. Expert opinion: The glycemic goals in patients with COVID-19 and concurrent type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are to avoid disruption of stable metabolic state, maintain optimal glycemic control, and prevent adverse glycemic events. Patients with T1DM require insulin therapy at all times to prevent ketosis. The management strategies for patients with T2DM include temporary discontinuation of certain oral antidiabetic agents and consideration for insulin therapy. Patients with T2DM who are relatively stable and able to eat regularly may continue with oral antidiabetic agents if glycemic control is satisfactory. Hyperglycemia may develop in patients with systemic corticosteroid treatment and should be managed upon accordingly. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Antidiabetic; coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19); diabetes; therapeutics; type 1 diabetes; types 2 diabetes","alpha glucosidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glitazone derivative; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; meglitinide; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sulfonylurea derivative; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; antidiabetic agent; corticosteroid; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; incretin; insulin; metformin; blood glucose monitoring; coronavirus disease 2019; disease predisposition; disease severity; glycemic control; hospital patient; human; hyperglycemia; in hospital hyperglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin treatment; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pharmaceutical care; Review; adverse event; comorbidity; complication; deprescription; glucose blood level; hospitalization; hyperglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient care planning; physiologic monitoring; therapy; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Blood Glucose; Comorbidity; COVID-19; Deprescriptions; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Disease Susceptibility; Glycemic Control; Hospitalization; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Insulin; Metformin; Monitoring, Physiologic; Patient Care Planning; SARS-CoV-2; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; Thiazolidinediones"

The Malaysian Ministry of Health had implemented a range of measures, such as the use of masks and social distancing, to reduce the risk of transmission. Traditionally, newborns are evaluated for neonatal jaundice using visual assessment, a capillary heel prick and serum bilirubin (SB) sampling in primary health-care clinics. This approach requires the physical presence of both parents and their newborns in the primary health-care clinics, causing crowding and increasing the risk of COVID-19 infections. To alleviate crowding, we implemented the transcutaneous bilirubin drive-through (DT) service, which is an established, non-invasive, painless and rapid method to determine the bilirubin levels. Throughout the screening, both parents and baby will be confined to their car. A total of 1842 babies were screened in our DT setting from April to July 2020. Of the total babies, 298 (16.1%) required venesection for SB measurement and 85 required admission for phototherapy. None with severe jaundice were missed since the implementation of this service. The average test duration per neonate was less than 5 min, while conventional venous bilirubin laboratory testing required an average of 1.5 h per neonate. The cost of the SB laboratory test and consumables was approximately USD 5 per test, with an estimated cost savings of USD 7720. DT screening may be introduced in health-care settings to reduce crowding and eliminate the need of painful blood sampling in newborns. © 2020 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",,"bilirubin; bilirubin; biological marker; Article; bilirubin blood level; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cost control; diagnostic test; disease association; disease transmission; drive through transcutaneous bilirubin screening; exchange blood transfusion; health service; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; newborn; newborn jaundice; phlebotomy; phototherapy; postoperative period; priority journal; risk factor; ambulatory care; blood; epidemiology; female; infection control; male; newborn jaundice; newborn screening; organization and management; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; Ambulatory Care; Bilirubin; Biomarkers; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infection Control; Jaundice, Neonatal; Malaysia; Male; Neonatal Screening; Pandemics"

Recommendations are in place to limit medical personnel attending to the neurosurgical patient as a protective measure and to conserve personal protective equipment. However, the complexity of the neurosurgical patient proves to be a challenge and an opportunity for innovation. The goal of our study was to determine if telemedicine delivered through smart glasses was feasible and effective in an alternative method of conducting ward round on neurocritical care patients during the pandemic. Methods: A random pair of neurosurgery resident and specialist conducted consecutive virtual and physical ward rounds on neurocritical patients. A virtual ward round was first conducted remotely by a specialist who received real-time audiovisual information from a resident wearing smart glasses integrated with telemedicine. Subsequently, a physical ward round was performed together by the resident and specialist on the same patient. The management plans of both ward rounds were compared, and the intrarater reliability was measured. On study completion a qualitative survey was performed. Results: Ten paired ward rounds were performed on 103 neurocritical care patients with excellent overall intrarater reliability. Nine out of 10 showed good to excellent internal consistency, and 1 showed acceptable internal consistency. Qualitative analysis indicated wide user acceptance and high satisfaction rate with the alternative method.

Against this backdrop, this paper presents a critical review of the catalogue of negative and positive impacts of the pandemic and proffers perspectives on how it can be leveraged to steer towards a better, more resilient low-carbon economy. The paper diagnosed the danger of relying on pandemic-driven benefits to achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes a need for a decisive, fundamental structural change to the dynamics of how we live. It argues for a rethink of the present global economic growth model, shaped by a linear economy system and sustained by profiteering and energy-gulping manufacturing processes, in favour of a more sustainable model recalibrated on circular economy (CE) framework. Building on evidence in support of CE as a vehicle for balancing the complex equation of accomplishing profit with minimal environmental harms, the paper outlines concrete sector-specific recommendations on CE-related solutions as a catalyst for the global economic growth and development in a resilient post-COVID-19 world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Climate change; COVID-19; Supply chain resilience; Sustainability; Sustainable development","Sustainable development; Viruses; Circular economy; Complex equations; Global economic growth; Global economies; Low carbon economy; Manufacturing process; Transmission rates; World Health Organization; Economics; carbon dioxide; climate change; COVID-19; disease transmission; economic growth; global economy; respiratory disease; supply chain management; sustainability; sustainable development; viral disease; virus; air quality; Article; automation; carbon footprint; China; commercial phenomena; competition; coronavirus disease 2019; cycling; economic aspect; economic development; economic recession; energy consumption; environmental management; food industry; government; health care policy; hospital waste; human; infection control; international cooperation; noise reduction; pandemic; profit; program sustainability; recycling; resource management; social distancing; socioeconomics; sustainable development; tourism; traffic and transport; virus transmission; walking; waste management; World Health Organization"

To provide scientific data to help identify risk factors for the psychosocial strain during the COVID-19 outbreak, an international cross-disciplinary online survey was circulated in April 2020. This report outlines the mental, emotional and behavioural consequences of COVID-19 home confinement. The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform and was promoted by thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North Africa, Western Asia and the Americas. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses “before” and “during” the confinement period. 1047 replies (54% women) from Western Asia (36%), North Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other continents (3%) were analysed. The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P < 0.001; 0.43 ≤ d ≤ 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing psychosocial and emotional disorders (+10% to +16.5%). These psychosocial tolls were associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing (i) physical (+15.2%) and social (+71.2%) inactivity, (ii) poor sleep quality (+12.8%), (iii) unhealthy diet behaviours (+10%), and (iv) unemployment (6%). Conversely, participants demonstrated a greater use (+15%) of technology during the confinement period. These findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the COVID-19 home confinement period and provide a clear remit for the urgent implementation of technology-based intervention to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle AHCL). © 2021 Institute of Sport.

This study aimed to systematically investigate the consistency of recommendations from the available clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to those of the WHO on the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods We examined CPGs and UpToDate point-of-care resources on the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients that had been published as of 30 April 2020 and compared them against the CPG by the WHO. The main outcome was the rate of consistency among CPGs for the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding recommendation statements that were described as insufficient evidence and by excluding single CPGs one at a time. Results Thirteen reference recommendations derived from the CPG of the WHO were generated using discrete and unambiguous specifications of the population, intervention, and comparison states. Across CPGs, the rate of consistency in direction with the WHO is 7.7%. When insufficient evidence codings were excluded, the rate of consistency increased substantially to 61.5%. The results of a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis suggested that the UpToDate recommendation source could explain the inconsistency. Consistency in direction rates changed by an absolute 23.1% (from 1/13 (7.7%) to 4/13 (30.8%)) if UpToDate was removed. Conclusions We observed inconsistencies between some recommendations of the CPGs and those of the WHO. These inconsistencies should best be addressed by consensus among the relevant bodies to avoid confusion in clinical practice while awaiting clinical trials to inform us of the best practice. © European Association of Hospital Pharmacists 2021.","clinical audit; clinical governance; clinical pharmacy; infectious diseases; intensive & critical care","corticosteroid; hypertensive factor; Article; clinical decision making; clinical pharmacy; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; cross-sectional study; data consistency; health care personnel; health care quality; human; mean arterial pressure; outcome assessment; oxygen saturation; oxygen therapy; point of care testing; population density; practice guideline; prophylaxis; public expenditure; publication; World Health Organization"

Therefore, this paper describes the result of a Nigerian sample (n = 385) regarding the proliferation of fake news on COVID-19. The fake news phenomenon was studied using the Uses and Gratification framework, which was extended by an “altruism” motivation. The data were analysed with Partial Least Squares (PLS) to determine the effects of six variables on the outcome of fake news sharing. Our results showed that altruism was the most significant factor that predicted fake news sharing of COVID-19. We also found that social media users’ motivations for information sharing, socialisation, information seeking and pass time predicted the sharing of false information about COVID-19. In contrast, no significant association was found for entertainment motivation.

This study proposes a clinical computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using CT features to automatically discriminate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Methods: Overall, 612 patients (306 COVID-19 and 306 non-COVID-19 pneumonia) were recruited. Twenty radiological features were extracted from CT images to evaluate the pattern, location, and distribution of lesions of patients in both groups. All significant CT features were fed in five classifiers namely decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and ensemble to evaluate the best performing CAD system in classifying COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. Results: Location and distribution pattern of involvement, number of the lesion, ground-glass opacity (GGO) and crazy-paving, consolidation, reticular, bronchial wall thickening, nodule, air bronchogram, cavity, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and lymphadenopathy are the significant features to classify COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups. Our proposed CAD system obtained the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.965, 93.54%, 90.32%, and 91.94%, respectively, using ensemble (COVIDiag) classifier. Conclusions: This study proposed a COVIDiag model obtained promising results using CT radiological routine features. It can be considered an adjunct tool by the radiologists during the current COVID-19 pandemic to make an accurate diagnosis. Key Points: • Location and distribution of involvement, number of lesions, GGO and crazy-paving, consolidation, reticular, bronchial wall thickening, nodule, air bronchogram, cavity, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and lymphadenopathy are the significant features between COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups. • The proposed CAD system, COVIDiag, could diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia cases with an AUC of 0.965 (sensitivity = 93.54%; specificity = 90.32%; and accuracy = 91.94%). • The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy obtained by radiologist diagnosis are 0.879, 87.10%, 88.71%, and 87.90%, respectively. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Machine learning; Pneumonia; Tomography, X-ray computed","adult; Article; Bayesian learning; bronchial wall thickening; bronchography; classifier; clinical feature; computer assisted diagnosis; coronavirus disease 2019; decision tree; feature extraction; female; human; k nearest neighbor; lung nodule; lymphadenopathy; major clinical study; male; multidetector computed tomography; pleura cavity; pleura effusion; pleura thickening; pneumonia; priority journal; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; thorax radiography; x-ray computed tomography"

Bulk of research on this virus are carried out to unveil its multivariate pathology. Surprisingly, men are reportedly more vulnerable to COVID-19 even with higher fatality rate compared to women. Thus, it is crucial to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can even affect male fertility as an immediate or long-term consequence of the disease. Among the discrete data available, an important finding is that angiotensin converting enzymes 2 (ACE2) receptor, that aids the SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is profoundly expressed in testicular cells. In addition, the endogenous androgen milieu and its receptors are associated with ACE2 activation reflecting that enhanced testosterone levels may trigger the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In contrary, hypogonadism has also been reported in the acute phase of some COVID-19 cases. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced uncontrolled inflammatory responses may lead to systemic oxidative stress (OS), whose severe disruptive effects on testicular functions are well-documented.

Methods: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. Results: Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. Conclusions: We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.

There is no specific vaccine or medication for the COVID-19 and current treatment relies on existing drugs including anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents. Here, we describe the potential use electromagnetic radiation to treat COVID-19 infected individuals. The electromagnetic radiation, particularly UV-C has so far proved to be highly effective as coronavirus disinfectant method on medical instruments and material surfaces. Photochemical mechanisms of UV-C with human cell could alter the single strand RNA and effective to obtain photodimeric lesions in nucleic acid of the virus. Inactivation mechanisms by photodimers induced in genome commonly lead to mutagenesis, where base pairing during viral RNA replication will be interfere usually at pyrimidine dimers. Therefore, application of UV-C at moderate intensities within periodical irradiation on patient might be useful to inactivate RNA of SARS-CoV-2 and can be used as an alternative for non-invasive treatment of COVID-19 patients. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Electromagnetic wave emission; Ionizing radiation; Noninvasive medical procedures; RNA; Viruses; Anti-inflammatory agents; Inactivation mechanisms; Medical instruments; Non-invasive treatment; Photochemical mechanism; Respiratory illness; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Structural proteins; Diseases"

Of these drugs, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have emerged as frontrunners and shown early promising results in treating COVID-19 in both in vitro and in vivo studies. However, these drugs have adverse side-effects and they became ineffectual due to eventual drug-resistance. Research is continuing by several means in search of potential therapeutics with minimal side-effects. The natural bioactive compounds from a plant sources generally have minimal toxicity can exert inhibitory capacity against coronavirus is of great interest. Up to now, various phytochemical compounds, namely arctiin, scutellarin, forsythoside, kaempferol, secoxyloganin, nicotianamine, saikosaponin, reported to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The mechanism of action appears to be inhibiting virus replication and blocking viral infection. Due to time taking cultivation, expensive extraction and isolation of bioactive constituents, it is essential to develop alternative techniques for the mass production of bioactive compounds in a less timeframe using in vitro methods of plant cell and callus culture methods. In the present work, we highlighted the importance of modern biotechnological approaches including cell or tissue or callus culture methods and plant-based antiviral compounds currently being tested to treat novel coronavirus. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cells; Drug interactions; Flavonoids; Metabolites; Plant cell culture; Tissue; Viruses; Adverse side effects; Antiviral compound; Bioactive compounds; Biotechnological approaches; Controlled environment; Mechanism of action; Secondary metabolites; Therapeutic potentials; Diseases"

Consequently, trade and travel have been recognized as significant determinants of the spread of disease. Additionally, the rise in urbanization and the closer integration of the world economy have facilitated global interconnectedness. Therefore, globalization has emerged as an essential mechanism of disease transmission. This paper aims to examine the potential impact of COVID-19 on globalization and global health in terms of mobility, trade, travel, and countries most impacted. The effect of globalization were operationalized in terms of mobility, economy, and healthcare systems. The mobility of individuals and its magnitude was assessed using airline and seaport trade data and travel information. The economic impact was measured based on the workforce, event cancellations, food and agriculture, academic institutions, and supply chain. The healthcare capacity was assessed by considering healthcare system indicators and preparedness of countries. Utilizing a technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), we calculated a pandemic vulnerability index (PVI) by creating a quantitative measure of the potential global health. The pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on the world economy, healthcare, and globalization through travel, events cancellation, employment workforce, food chain, academia, and healthcare capacity. Based on PVI results, certain countries were more vulnerable than others. In Africa, more vulnerable countries included South Africa and Egypt; in Europe, they were Russia, Germany, and Italy; in Asia and Oceania, they were India, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey; and for the Americas, they were Brazil, USA, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. The impact on mobility, economy, and healthcare systems has only started to manifest. The findings of this study may help in the planning and implementation of strategies at the country level to help ease this emerging burden. © 2020 The Authors","COVID-19; Economic impact; Global Health; Globalization; Infectious diseases; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; TOPSIS","Africa; Article; Asia; Brazil; Chile; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; Egypt; employment; Europe; food chain; Germany; global health; globalization; health care system; human; India; Iran; Italy; Mexico; movement (physiology); Pacific islands; Pakistan; pandemic; Peru; quantitative study; Russian Federation; Saudi Arabia; South Africa; trade union; travel; Turkey (republic); United States; Western Hemisphere; workforce"

The 3CL protease (3CLpro) is the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the viral replication and therefore considered as an attractive drug target since to date there is no specific and effective vaccine available against this virus. In this paper, we reported molecular docking-based virtual screening (VS) of 2000 compounds obtained from the ZINC database and 10 FDA-approved (antiviral and anti-malaria) on 3CLpro using AutoDock Vina to find potential inhibitors. The screening results showed that the top four compounds, namely ZINC32960814, ZINC12006217, ZINC03231196, and ZINC33173588 exhibited high affinity at the 3CLpro binding pocket. Their free energy of binding (FEB) were −12.3, −11.9, −11.7, and −11.2 kcal/mol while AutoDock Vina scores were −12.61, −12.32, −12.01, and -11.92 kcal/mol, respectively. These results were better than the co-crystallized ligand N3, whereby its FEB was −7.5 kcal/mol and FDA-approved drugs. Different but stable interactions were obtained between the four identified compounds with the catalytic dyad residues of the 3CLpro. In conclusion, novel 3CLpro inhibitors from the ZINC database were successfully identified using VS and molecular docking approach, fulfilling the Lipinski rule of five, and having low FEB and functional molecular interactions with the target protein. The findings suggests that the identified compounds may serve as potential leads that act as COVID-19 3CLpro inhibitors, worthy for further evaluation and development. © Copyright © 2020 Abdusalam and Murugaiyah.","3CL protease; COVID-19; docking; SARS-CoV-2; virtual screening; ZINC database",

Supported by the conservation of resources theory, the current study extends the literature on problematic social media usage during COVID-19 by investigating its association with emotional and mental health outcomes. In a moderated mediation model, this study proposes that problematic social media use by workers during COVID-19 is linked to fear of COVID-19, which is further associated with depression. The current study tested trait mindfulness as an important personal resource that may be associated with reduced fear of COVID-19 despite problematic social media use. The study collected temporally separate data to avoid common method bias. Pakistani employees (N = 267) working in different organizations completed a series of survey questionnaires. The results supported the moderated mediation model, showing that problematic social media use during the current pandemic is linked to fear of COVID-19 and depression among employees. Furthermore, trait mindfulness was found to be an important buffer, reducing the negative indirect association between problematic social media use and depression through fear of COVID-19. These results offer implications for practitioners.

The virus gets deposited in the human nasal cavity and moves to the lungs that might be fatal. As per safety guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO), social distancing has emerged as one of the major factors to avoid the spread of infection. However, different guidelines are being followed across the countries with regards to what should be the safe distance. Thus, the current work is an attempt to understand the virus deposition pattern in the realistic human nasal cavity and also to find the impact of distance that could be termed as a safety measure. This study is performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics as a solution tool to investigate the impact of COVID-19 deposition (i) On a realistic 3D human upper airway model and (ii) 2D social distancing protocol for a distance of 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 m. The results revealed that the regional deposition flux within the nasal cavity was predominantly observed in the external nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal section. Frequent flushing of these regions with saltwater substitutes can limit contamination in healthy individuals. The safe distancing limit estimated with 1 m/s airflow was about 1.8 m. The extensive deposition was observed for distances less than 1.8 m in this study, emphasizing the fact that social distancing advisories are not useful and do not take into account the external dynamics associated with airflow. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

As a response to the closure of schools and universities by the Malaysian government, Universiti Teknologi MARA was among the earliest that announced the continuation of semester via online learning. Immediately after the statement, students flocked to social medias expressing negative sentiments on the university's decision. They voiced possible difficulties such as inability to focus, problems accessing the Internet, and feelings of unfairness. These concerns of students are worthy of a study as they feel strongly about them even without having entirely gone an online learning experience at the time of announcement. With that in mind, this paper explores issues on learning during a pandemic by focusing especially on recent and early reports that have only been published once COVID-19 epidemic becomes a global issue. Result of these reviews on literature shows that these issues can be categorized into six: Technological readiness, technological knowledge, financial, facility, emotional, and domestic situations. These six categories are not by any means conclusive and other arising issues discovered in the future may necessitate the creation of new categories. However, findings from the categories discussed here are enough to be used as a stepping point for further explorations. For example, as the backdrop against a research of students' experience after completion of online learning, where their earlier sentiments can either be verified, or challenged against. © 2020 IEEE.","emergency remote teaching; online learning; online learning issues","Digital storage; Human computer interaction; Students; Existing systems; Global issues; Malaysian governments; Negative sentiments; Online learning; Social media; Technological knowledge; E-learning"

However, there has been considerable controversy surrounding some treatments. This includes hydroxychloroquine where the initial hype and misinformation lead to shortages, price rises and suicides. Price rises and shortages have also been seen for PPE. Such activities can have catastrophic effects on patients where there are high co-payment levels and issues of affordability. Consequently, there is a need to investigate this further. Objective: Assess changes in the availability, utilization and prices of relevant medicines and PPE during the pandemic among a range of Asian countries. Our approach: Narrative literature review combined with interviews among community pharmacists to assess changes in consumption, prices and shortages of medicines and PPE from the beginning of March 2020 until end of May 2020. In addition, suggestions on ways to reduce misinformation. Results: 308 pharmacists took part from five Asian countries. There was an appreciable increase in the utilization of antimicrobials in Pakistan (in over 88% of pharmacies), with lower increases or no change in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia and Vietnam. Encouragingly, there was increased use of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE across the countries, as well as limited price rises for antimicrobials in India, Malaysia and Vietnam, although greater price rises seen for analgesics and vitamin C/immune boosters. Appreciable price increases were also seen for PPE across some countries. Conclusion: Encouraging to see increases in utilization of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE. However, increases in the utilization and prices of antimicrobials is a concern that needs addressing alongside misinformation and any unintended consequences from the pandemic. Community pharmacists can play a key role in providing evidence-based advice, helping to moderate prices, as well as helping address some of the unintended consequences of the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Godman, Haque, Islam, Iqbal, Urmi, Kamal, Shuvo, Rahman, Kamal, Haque, Jahan, Islam, Hossain, Munzur-E-Murshid, Kumar, Charan, Bhatt, Dutta, Abhayanand, Sharma, Saleem, Phuong, Kwon, Kurdi, Wale and Sefah.","Bangladesh; community pharmacists; COVID-19; India; Malaysia; Pakistan; price rises; Vietnam","essential drug; hydroxychloroquine; Asia; cost; economics; human; pharmacy (shop); protective equipment; public health; therapy; Asia; Costs and Cost Analysis; COVID-19; Drugs, Essential; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Personal Protective Equipment; Pharmacies; Public Health"

The S-glycoprotein in the virus is the key factor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, which contains two functional domains: S1 is an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding domain, and S2 is necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, mRNA level expression of Furin enzyme and ACE2 receptor had been reported in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals. However, the expression patterns of ACE2 and Furin in different cell types of oral tissues are still unclear. Methods: In order to investigate the potential infective channel of the new coronavirus via the oropharyngeal cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and Furin in human oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was performed in mucosal tissue from different oral anatomical sites to confirm the expression of ACE2 and Furin at the protein level. Results: The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and Furin on epithelial cells from different oral anatomical sites. Immunohistochemistry results revealed that both the ACE2-positive and Furin-positive cells in the target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in fibroblasts, further confirming the bioinformatics results. Conclusions: Based on these findings, we speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could invade oral mucosal cells through two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by Furin protease. Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 that could facilitate COVID-19 infection via respiratory and fecal–oral routes. © Copyright © 2020 Zhong, Lin, Pathak, Gao, Young, Wang, Liu, Wu, Liu, Chen, Huang, Lee, Qi, Ge and Wang.","ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-2); COVID-19; Furin; oral mucosa; SARS-CoV-2; single cell RNA seq","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor; CD19 antigen; CD2 antigen; CD20 antigen; CD3 antigen; CD79a antigen; furin; receptor; receptor type tyrosine protein phosphatase C; unclassified drug; adult; Article; B lymphocyte; bioinformatics; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; fibroblast; gene expression profiling; gingiva; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; lip; middle aged; mouth epithelium cell; mRNA expression level; palate; protein expression level; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; single cell RNA seq; T lymphocyte; target tissue; tongue"

The virus quickly spread around the world, causing a sustained global outbreak. Although SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) are highly similar genetically and at the protein production level, there are significant differences between them. Research has shown that the structural spike (S) protein plays an important role in the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. So far, studies have shown that various genes encoding primarily for elements of S protein undergo frequent mutation. We have performed an in-depth review of the literature covering the structural and mutational aspects of S protein in the context of SARS-CoV-2, and compared them with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Our analytical approach consisted in an initial genome and transcriptome analysis, followed by primary, secondary and tertiary protein structure analysis. Additionally, we investigated the potential effects of these differences on the S protein binding and interactions to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and we established, after extensive analysis of previous research articles, that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use different ends/regions in S protein receptor-binding motif (RBM) and different types of interactions for their chief binding with ACE2. These differences may have significant implications on pathogenesis, entry and ability to infect intermediate hosts for these coronaviruses. This review comprehensively addresses in detail the variations in S protein, its receptor-binding characteristics and detailed structural interactions, the process of cleavage involved in priming, as well as other differences between coronaviruses.","coronaviruses; COVID-19; proline; receptor-binding motif; spike protein; terminal region","coronavirus spike glycoprotein; binding site; chemistry; genetics; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; molecular dynamics; pathology; protein tertiary structure; SARS coronavirus; virology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Binding Sites; COVID-19; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Protein Structure, Tertiary; SARS Virus; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus"

"Impact of the Inflow Population From Outbreak Areas on the COVID-19 Epidemic in Yunnan Province and the Recommended Control Measures: A Preliminary Study",2020,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097674962&doi=10.3389%2ffpubh.2020.609974&partnerID=40&md5=f67a7678529ed7ed872cf9bc5b1d51b4","Background: COVID-19 developed into a global pandemic in 2020 and poses challenges regarding the prevention and control capabilities of countries. A large number of inbound travelers from other regions could lead to a renewed outbreak of COVID-19 in the local regions. Globally, as a result of the imbalance in the control of the epidemic, all countries are facing the risk of a renewed COVID-19 outbreak brought about by travelers from epidemic areas. Therefore, studies on a proper management of the inbound travelers are urgent. Methods: We collected a total of 4,733,414 inbound travelers and 174 COVID-19 diagnosed patients in Yunnan province from 21 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. Data on place of origin, travel history, age, and gender, as well as whether they had suspected clinical manifestations for inbound travelers in Yunnan were collected. The impact of inbound travelers on the local epidemic was analyzed with a collinear statistical analysis and the effect of the control measures on the epidemic was evaluated with a sophisticated modeling approach. Results: Of the 174 COVID-19 patients, 60.9% were not from Yunnan, and 76.4% had a history of travel in Hubei. The amount of new daily cases in Yunnan was significant correlated with the number of inbound travelers from Hubei and suspected cases among them. Using Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR) model analysis, we found that the prevention and control measures dropped the local R0 down to 1.07 in Yunnan province. Conclusions: Our preliminary analysis showed that the proper management of inbound travelers from outbreak areas has a significantly positive effect on the prevention and control of the virus. In the process of resettlement, some effective measures taken by Yunnan province may provide an important reference for preventing the renewed COVID-19 outbreak in other regions. © Copyright © 2020 Sun, He, Huang, Chen, Zhang, Zhao, Zhao, Yang, Yang, Xiong, Karuppiah, Kumar, He and Xiong.","control measures; COVID-19; epidemic area; inbound travelers; resettlement",

This online, cross-sectional survey recruited 399 participants from two university hospitals, and they were administered a self-reported questionnaire on demographic, personal, and clinical characteristics, as well as COVID-19-related stressors and coping. In addition, they completed the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) to measure perceived social support, as well as the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess depression, anxiety, and stress. We found that the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress were 21.8%, 31.6%, and 29.1%, respectively. Participants with moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress made up 13.3%, 25.8%, and 8.1% of the sample, respectively. Being single or divorced, fear of frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients, agreeing that the area of living had a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases, uncertainty regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the area of living, and a history of pre-existing psychiatric illnesses were associated with higher odds of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conversely, having more than three children and greater perceived friend support were associated with lower odds of depression, anxiety, and stress. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress remained elevated even after the MCO was lifted. © 2020 by the authors.

Hence, healing through music uses the frequency or the combination of the voice and music or the musical element, such as harmony, rhythm and melody, to enhance healing. Music therapy and al Quran theraphy are an effective treatment for overcoming stress problems, for example, increasing one's mood and being accepted by anybody. Healing through sound results from the belief that everything in this world vibrates. Hence, treatment through music uses frequencies or sound that is combined with music or musical elements to enhance healing. The focus is on physiological changes, such as blood pressure, muscle relaxation or the pulse. The effectiveness of sound therapy differs depending on the type, frequency, environment and the level of sound during treatment.

In many hospitals and health care facilities, services and health care workers have been reorganized and restructured to meet the demands of the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on hospital-based clinical pharmacists and their ability to deliver pharmaceutical care is currently unknown. Objective: This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital-based clinical pharmacists working in Malaysia and the implications on how clinical pharmacy is perceived as a health care service. Methods: A qualitative study was designed to meet the research objectives. Nineteen hospital-based clinical pharmacists consented and participated in one-on-one, semi-structured interviews. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using an iterative thematic analysis approach. Results: The experiences and views of the participants were reported. Three main themes were developed: “Reassignment and other changes in clinical pharmacist roles,” “Adapting clinical pharmacy services to COVID-19,” and “The need for clinical pharmacists in the ward.” The findings indicate that in many cases, clinical pharmacy services were fully or partially withdrawn from the ward to reduce the risk of infection and to conserve the usage of personal protective equipment. Despite this, clinical pharmacists continued to support patient care in hospitals through the use of technology. The withdrawal of clinical pharmacy services, however, raises concern that the role of clinical pharmacists is still poorly recognized. Conclusion: Clinical pharmacists in hospitals continue to support patient care despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater support and recognition of their role is required in order to empower and enhance their ability to deliver pharmaceutical care. © 2020 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.","clinical pharmacists; coronavirus; hospital pharmacy services","Article; clinical article; clinical pharmacist; clinical pharmacy; coronavirus disease 2019; drug information; female; human; intensive care unit; interpersonal communication; Malaysia; male; medication compliance; patient care; patient counseling; pharmaceutical care; practice guideline; priority journal; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; role change"

As many educators and students braved the situation, and until a remedy is found to prevent the spread of this deadly coronavirus, the question that lingers in the mind of many people is ‘Will online learning be the way forward for university students in post COVID-19’? Most past research have reported on students’ experience of online mode of learning via a blended learning approach but there is relatively little research focusing on the real experience of students embarking on full online learning mode, especially in the state of Sarawak. Thus, this quantitative research aimed to identify the level of acceptance of online learning among university students who have experienced full online learning mode. It also intended to identify the factors that facilitated online learning and the challenges of online learning among university students. Data were collected using an online survey involving 156 respondents from a public university in the state of Sarawak. The data collected from the survey were analysed using descriptive statistics (means, frequency counts and percentages). Results showed a moderate high level of acceptance of online learning among the university students. In addition, results revealed that among the four main factors that facilitated online learning among the students, enhancement of English language skills ranked the highest, followed by enthusiasm, self-efficacy and satisfaction. This study also found that among the main challenges encountered by the majority of the students are issues of delivery speed of teaching and learning, students’ attitude, struggles and stress of online learning mode. Results yielded in this study add to the existing literature on the possibility of online learning as an alternative pedagogy in post COVID-19 for the education sector. © 2020.

In this condition, performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) is time-sensitive and increases virus transmission risk. The dilemma of treating a stridorous patient with laryngeal carcinoma and concurrent COVID-19 positive with pneumonia is possibly become a new normal in this era. Case Report: A 66-year-old male, chronic smoker, completed six days of in-patient treatment for community-acquired pneumonia when the RT-PCR for COVID-19 was found to be negative. He was seen in the otorhinolaryngology (ORL) clinic two weeks later due to hoarseness for two months associated with worsening shortness of breath and cough. He had soft stridor at rest and was mildly tachypnoeic. Flexible endoscopy revealed a mass on the right immobile vocal cord with a small glottic airway. A repeat nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 on the same day was positive. A detailed discussion involving a multidisciplinary team lead to the decision to secure the patient’s airway by first intubating him with a small endotracheal tube and followed by tracheostomy in the same setting. Here, the experience in managing upper airway obstruction due to laryngeal carcinoma (at least T3) in a patient with stage 4 COVID-19 is presented and discussed. The challenges emerged due to the inevitable series of AGPs that need to be performed. Multidisciplinary team involvement comprises ORL surgeon, anesthetist, infectious disease, and respiratory physician is pertinent. Conclusion: This is the first case in the literature on a stridorous COVID-19 positive patient with laryngeal carcinoma that requires emergency tracheostomy. The case highlights the challenges and decision-making in managing such cases that are supposed to be straightforward before the COVID-19 pandemic era. This shall be the new normal for otorhinolaryngologists, anesthetists, and maybe any other specialties who deal with AGPs. © 2020, Sanglah General Hospital.

Much business expertise predicted that it would take longer time for the industry to recover especially on the international tourism market. This is due to changes in people's behaviour relating to social distancing, personal hygiene and safety, and likelihood to be more vigilant to travel overseas in the future. While Malaysia and Indonesia are recognized as prominent health tourism destinations in South East Asia, these countries are deeply distressed by this transformation too. Therefore, this paper discusses the positive images of these destinations to help tourism players to improve their marketing strategies during this critical time.

Daily updates on new cases and deaths are proving that the efforts so far made toward curtailing the virus have not been effective. Employing the Health Belief Model approach, the study through the quantitative method evaluated the impact of perceived susceptibility on self-efficacy and perceived severity toward cues to action in curbing the spread of Covid-19 infections in Nigeria. Key findings showed that only 12.4 % of the respondents had a high level of Covid-19 susceptibility. Moreover, the two independent variables were able to contribute small and medium variance effect sizes on perceived susceptibility and cues to action. Perceived susceptibility also had partial mediation effects on the relationships between self-efficacy, perceived severity, and cues to action respectively. Therefore, it is recommended that the levels of Nigerians' Covid-19 perceived susceptibilities need to be raised to strengthen the effectiveness of self-efficacy and perceived severity for cues to action toward curbing the spread of the Covid-19 infections in the country.

The perception that vaccination decreases the chances of getting COVID-19 under the perceived benefit construct (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 2.05-4.83) and not being concerned about the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines under the perceived barriers construct (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.31-2.09) were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of WTP for COVID-19 vaccine was CNY¥200/US$28 (IQR CNY¥100-500/USD$14-72). The highest marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by socio-economic factors. The majority were confident (48.7%) and completely confident (46.1%) in domestically-made COVID-19 vaccine. 64.2% reported a preference for a domestically-made over foreign-made COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the utility of HBM constructs in understanding COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP. It is important to improve health promotion and reduce the barriers to COVID-19 vaccination.",,"administration and dosage; adolescent; adult; aged; behavior; China; cross-sectional study; economics; epidemiology; female; human; male; middle aged; patient attitude; psychology; questionnaire; vaccination; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; China; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination; Young Adult"

COVID-19 patients have a symptom of respiratory pneumonia diseases which have difficulties in breathing normally. Previously, the nebulizer machine commonly used to treat respiratory pneumonia diseases. However, the usage for this machine was not suggested during this COVID-19 period because the virus will be spread off easily. To overcome these shortcomings, the uses of Metered-Dose Inhaler (MDI) with MDI disposable inhaler spacer is preferable. Besides, it had been known that the used of MDI disposable inhaler spacer helps to increase the uptaking of the drug into the lung. Besides that, the high demand for the MDI Disposable Inhaler Spacer in the hospital, causing a shortage of supply in Malaysia. Thus, this study aims to produce a new design of this spacer to full fill the market need. This new design of MDI Disposable Inhaler Spacer (AeroCup) was designed by using Solid Work 2018. Then, the parameters for flow characteristic such as particle velocity magnitude, velocity, Eddy viscosity, turbulence Eddy dissipation and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) was successfully characterized and compared with commercial design A using ANSYS Fluent Version 19.2. The result showed that new design (AeroCup) had the desired characteristic, which was almost similar to commercial design A. This study can provide a piece of information to produce the low-cost metered-dose inhaler (MDI) disposable inhaler spacer to enlighten the burden shouldered by front liners, especially during the pandemic and also can scale-up the economic viability. © 2020 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU - All rights reserved.","Disposable; Metered-dose inhalers; Simulation; Spacer",

The education sector is one of the worst sufferers due to the official closures of educational institutions worldwide. The government of Bangladesh has declared all the on-campus activities shut in March 2020. This paper explains the effect of faculty and student readiness in adopting virtual classes considering the mediating effect of technology adoption intention. Teachers and students from private and public universities in Bangladesh are surveyed for this research. The findings revealed that the private universities are well ahead of providing online education as their faculty and students are ready with logistics and mindset to adopt technology-based virtual learning while the public university stakeholders are yet to initiate it. It is concluded that the lack of readiness of public universities will create a massive gap between public and private university education and rural and urban students as well. The proposed model of this research can help the policymakers and the government in formulating policy guidelines for bringing all the students and teachers on virtual education platforms irrespective of their university affiliations. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

Chest Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective method for detecting lung illnesses, including COVID-19. However, the CT scan is expensive and timeconsuming. Therefore, this work focus on detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images because it is widely available, faster, and cheaper than CT scan. Many machine learning approaches such as Deep Learning, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine; have used X-ray for detecting the COVID-19. Although the performance of those approaches is acceptable in terms of accuracy, however, they require high computational time and more memory space. Therefore, this work employs an Optimised Genetic Algorithm-Extreme Learning Machine (OGA-ELM) with three selection criteria (i.e., random, K-tournament, and roulette wheel) to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. The most crucial strength factors of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are: (i) high capability of the ELM in avoiding overfitting; (ii) its usability on binary and multi-type classifiers; and (iii) ELM could work as a kernelbased support vector machine with a structure of a neural network. These advantages make the ELM efficient in achieving an excellent learning performance. ELMs have successfully been applied in many domains, including medical domains such as breast cancer detection, pathological brain detection, and ductal carcinoma in situ detection, but not yet tested on detecting COVID-19. Hence, this work aims to identify the effectiveness of employing OGA-ELM in detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. In order to reduce the dimensionality of a histogram oriented gradient features, we use principal component analysis. The performance of OGA-ELM is evaluated on a benchmark dataset containing 188 chest X-ray images with two classes: a healthy and a COVID-19 infected. The experimental result shows that the OGA-ELM achieves 100.00% accuracy with fast computation time. This demonstrates that OGA-ELM is an efficient method for COVID-19 detecting using chest X-ray images. © 2020 Albadr et al.",,"Article; artificial neural network; autoanalysis; classifier; clinical effectiveness; coronavirus disease 2019; dimensionality reduction; extreme learning machine; genetic algorithm; histogram; human; image analysis; kernel method; machine learning; measurement accuracy; optimised genetic algorithm; principal component analysis; support vector machine; thorax radiography; algorithm; diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; isolation and purification; lung; pathogenicity; pathophysiology; thorax; virology; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; COVID-19; Humans; Lung; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; SARS-CoV-2; Support Vector Machine; Thorax; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

In Ghana, food production, both agriculture and fisheries, is exempted from restrictions as an essential service. The enforcement of COVID-19 prevention protocols, particularly social distancing, has been widely reported in Ghana’s agricultural markets whereas casual observations and media reports on fish landing sites suggest no such enforcements are in place. This study aimed to provide sound scientific evidence as a basis for informed policy direction and intervention for the artisanal fishing sector in these challenging times. We employed an unmanned aerial vehicle in assessing the risk of artisanal fishers to the pandemic using physical distancing as a proxy. From analysis of cumulative distribution function (G-function) of the nearest-neighbour distances, this study underscored crowding at all surveyed fish landing beaches, and identified potential “hotspots” for disease transmission. Aerial measurements taken at times of peak landing beach activity indicated that the highest proportion of people, representing 56%, 48%, 39% and 78% in Elmina, Winneba, Apam and Mumford respectively, were located at distances of less than one metre from their nearest neighbour. Risk of crowding was independent of the population at the landing beaches, suggesting that all categories of fish landing sites along the coast would require equal urgency and measured attention towards preventing and mitigating the spread of the disease. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"crowding (area); epidemiology; fishery; geographic information system; Ghana; human; prevention and control; remote sensing; risk; COVID-19; Crowding; Fisheries; Geographic Information Systems; Ghana; Humans; Physical Distancing; Remote Sensing Technology; Risk; SARS-CoV-2"

Materials and Methods This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at Altamash Institute of Dental Medicine, Karachi from June 2020 to August 2020. A total of 775 patients participated to fill questionnaire. After scrutiny, 25 questionnaire forms were excluded due to incomplete information. Questionnaire was divided in to four sections. First section obtained patients sociodemographic information, while knowledge of patients regarding cross-infection control during COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated in second section. Similarly, the purpose of third section was to assess attitude and fourth section was designed to evaluate practice. Likert's 3-point scale was used for registration of participant's response. The reliability of questionnaire was assessed through Crohnbach's α (α = 0.74). Statistical analysis was performed after entering data in to SPSS version 25. Independent t -test was used to evaluate the difference in patients' knowledge, attitude, and practice. A p -value ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results Majority of the participants agreed that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease (631, 97%) and daily screening of staff, dental assistants, dentists, and patients is necessary (568, 75.7%) along with proper sterilization of instruments and disinfection of dental operatory (650, 86.66%). A large number of participant also agreed that proper disposal of waste is utmost important for cross-infection control (601, 80.24%) and patient's waiting area should also be marked with social distancing sign (620, 82.66%). However, when asked about the common route of COVID-19 transmission in dentistry, 341 (45.5%) participants disagreed that it is not through aerosol (water droplets) generated during dental procedures. Conclusions Dental health professionals should take additional measures to educate dental patients on mechanism of potential spread of COVID-19 through the aerosols and droplets generated during dental procedures. They should also encourage the dental patients to be vigilant and question the cross-infection control measures practiced by the dentist to whom they go for dental treatment, and to decrease their chances of acquiring an infection during their visit to the dental office. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

A thorough literature search of the PubMed/Embase/Web of Science/Cochrane central database was conducted to identify the impact of COVID-19 on oral health. We reviewed the recommendations on the recent guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention infection control practices for dentistry, American Dental Association, and the World Health Organization. According to the available evidence, COVID-19 may have a negative impact on the oral health due to the infection itself and due to various other consequences such as therapeutic measures, xerostomia, and other complications of the COVID-19. In light of the above facts, dentists should be wary of the disease, its identification, mode of spread and impacts on the oral health. The dental personnel have been identified as at the highest risk of getting COVID-19 due to cross infection from contact with their patients and aerosols generated in routine dental procedures. As such, they should be aware of the modifications that need to be made to the practice to prevent transmission of the disease. It is evident that COVID-19 has a negative impact on the oral health and at the same time a significant transmission risk to the dental personnel and patients who visit the clinic. If the recommendations issued by the regulatory authorities are meticulously followed, the risk of disease transmission can be lessened. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Our study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, preparedness, counselling practices of healthcare workers regarding COVID-19, and the perceived barriers to adequately prevent and control COVID-19 in Yemen. Methods Healthcare workers (HCWs) from major healthcare facilities participated in this cross-sectional study. A self-administered questionnaire comprising of five main domains (demographics, knowledge, self-preparedness, counselling practice, perceived barriers) was distributed among HCWs after obtaining informed consent. A convenient sampling technique was used. Descriptive and inferential analyses were applied using SPSS software. Results A total of 1000 participants were initially targeted to participate in the study with 514 (51.4%) responding, of which 55.3% were female. Physicians and nurses constituted the largest proportion of participants, with 39.5% and 33.3%, respectively. The median scores for knowledge, self-preparedness, and counselling practice were 8 (out of 9), 9 (out of 15), and 25 (out of 30), respectively. The physician group showed a statistically significant association with better knowledge compared to the nurse group only, P<0.001. Males had higher preparedness scores than females, p<0.001. Also, the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency departments presented a statistically significant difference by which the participants from these departments were more prepared compared to the others (e.g. outpatients, paediatrics and surgery) with P < 0.0001. The lack of awareness among the general population about COVID-19 preventive measures was perceived as the most common barrier for the adequate prevention and control of COVID-19 in Yemen (89.1%). Conclusion The major highlight of this study is that HCWs have, overall, good knowledge, suboptimal preparedness, and adequate counselling practices prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Yemen, despite the high number of perceived barriers. However, urgent action and interventions are needed to improve the preparedness of HCWs to manage COVID-19. The perceived barriers also need to be fully addressed by the local healthcare authorities and international organisations working in Yemen for adequate prevention and control measures to be in place in managing COVID-19. © 2020 Al-Ashwal et al.

Due to the importance of issue and the lack of general statistics on these disorders among the Hospital staff treating the COVID-19 patients, this study aims to systematically review and determine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this research work, the systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression approaches are used to approximate the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. The keywords of prevalence, anxiety, stress, depression, psychopathy, mental illness, mental disorder, doctor, physician, nurse, hospital staff, 2019-nCoV, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and Coronaviruses were used for searching the SID, MagIran, IranMedex, IranDoc, ScienceDirect, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases. The search process was conducted in December 2019 to June 2020. In order to amalgamate and analyze the reported results within the collected studies, the random effects model is used. The heterogeneity of the studies is assessed using the I2 index. Lastly, the data analysis is performed within the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Results: Of the 29 studies with a total sample size of 22,380, 21 papers have reported the prevalence of depression, 23 have reported the prevalence of anxiety, and 9 studies have reported the prevalence of stress. The prevalence of depression is 24.3% (18% CI 18.2–31.6%), the prevalence of anxiety is 25.8% (95% CI 20.5–31.9%), and the prevalence of stress is 45% (95% CI 24.3–67.5%) among the hospitals’ Hospital staff caring for the COVID-19 patients. According to the results of meta-regression analysis, with increasing the sample size, the prevalence of depression and anxiety decreased, and this was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05), however, the prevalence of stress increased with increasing the sample size, yet this was not statistically significant (P = 0.829). Conclusion: The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients is high. Therefore, the health policy-makers should take measures to control and prevent mental disorders in the Hospital staff. © 2020, The Author(s).","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers; Stress","adult; anxiety; depression; female; health care personnel; hospital personnel; human; job stress; male; mental disease; mental stress; meta analysis; middle aged; nurse; physician; prevalence; psychology; Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Nurses; Occupational Stress; Personnel, Hospital; Physicians; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological"

We modified the SIR model to specifically simulate the early depleting transmission dynamics of COVID-19 to better predict its temporal trend in Malaysia. The classical SIR model was fitted to observed total (I total), active (I) and removed (R) cases of COVID-19 before lockdown to estimate the basic reproduction number. Next, the model was modified with a partial time-varying force of infection, given by a proportionally depleting transmission coefficient, βt and a fractional term, z. The modified SIR model was then fitted to observed data over 6 weeks during the lockdown. Model fitting and projection were validated using the mean absolute percent error (MAPE). The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 was interrupted immediately by the lockdown. The modified SIR model projected the depleting temporal trends with lowest MAPE for I total, followed by I, I daily and R. During lockdown, the dynamics of COVID-19 depleted at a rate of 4.7% each day with a decreased capacity of 40%. For 7-day and 14-day projections, the modified SIR model accurately predicted I total, I and R. The depleting transmission dynamics for COVID-19 during lockdown can be accurately captured by time-varying SIR model. Projection generated based on observed data is useful for future planning and control of COVID-19. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"biological model; epidemiology; human; Malaysia; pandemic; prevention and control; therapy; COVID-19; Humans; Malaysia; Models, Biological; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2"

Because COVID-19 is primarily manifesting as an acute respiratory illness with interstitial and alveolar pneumonia, the possibility of viral invasions into the other organs cannot be disregarded. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been associated with various viral infections including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and HIV. The prevalence and risks of AKI during the course of COVID-19 have been described in few studies. However, the existing literature demonstrate great disparity across findings amid variations in methodology and population. This article underscores the propensity of AKI among COVID-19 patients, limitations of the exiting evidence, and importance of timely identification during the case management. The prevalence of AKI is variable across the studies ranging from 4.7% to 81%. Evidence suggest old age, comorbidities, ventilator support, use of vasopressors, black race, severe infection, and elevated levels of baseline serum creatinine and d-dimers are independent risk factors of COVID-19 associated with AKI. COVID-19 patients with AKI also showed unsatisfactory renal recovery and higher mortality rate as compared with patients without AKI. These findings underscore that AKI frequently occurs during the course of COVID-19 infection and requires early stratification and management. © 2020 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.",,"creatinine; D dimer; hypertensive factor; vasoconstrictor agent; acute kidney failure; age; artificial ventilation; Black person; chikungunya; clinical feature; comorbidity; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; creatinine blood level; dengue; disease association; disease course; disease severity; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; interstitial pneumonia; mortality rate; prevalence; respiratory tract disease; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; Zika fever; acute kidney failure; adverse event; diabetes mellitus; growth, development and aging; hospitalization; hypertension; kidney; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; respiratory distress syndrome; virology; Acute Kidney Injury; African Continental Ancestry Group; Age Factors; Comorbidity; COVID-19; Diabetes Mellitus; Hospitalization; Humans; Hypertension; Kidney; Pandemics; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Vasoconstrictor Agents"

We do not know its exact mortality rate nor the speed through which it spreads across communities. This lack of evidence complicates the design of appropriate response policies. Methods: We source daily death registry data for 4100 municipalities in Italy's north and match them to Census data. We augment the dataset with municipality-level data on a host of co-factors of COVID-19 mortality, which we exploit in a differences-in-differences regression model to analyze COVID-19-induced mortality. Results: We find that COVID-19 killed more than 0.15% of the local population during the first wave of the epidemic. We also show that official statistics vastly underreport this death toll, by about 60%. Next, we uncover the dramatic effects of the epidemic on nursing home residents in the outbreak epicenter: in municipalities with a high share of the elderly living in nursing homes, COVID-19 mortality was about twice as high as in those with no nursing home intown. Conclusions: A pro-active approach in managing the epidemic is key to reduce COVID-19 mortality. Authorities should ramp-up testing capacity and increase contact-tracing abilities. Adequate protective equipment should be provided to nursing home residents and staff. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health.

Materials and Methods: A sequential systematic literature search was conducted from December 2019 to 30 April 2020 through PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded the following results: “COVID-19” (n = 12,137), “Novel corona virus” (n = 63), “COVID-19 and dentistry” (n = 46), “COVID-19 and oral health” (n = 41), “Novel Corona virus and Dentistry” (n = 0), “dental health and Novel Coronavirus” (n = 26), and “dental practice and Novel Coronavirus” (n = 6). Results: After a careful review and eliminating articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final review included 13 articles. Management of infection control is discussed extensively in the literature and remains the main theme of many Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) articles on dentistry. Telephone triage using a questionnaire, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) for clinical and nonclinical staff, a preprocedural mouth rinse, and aerosol management have been discussed and implemented in few countries. Three studies recommended that elective treatments for patients with a temperature of &gt;100.4 F or 38◦C should be postponed or performed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) or negative-pressure room. Limiting the number of patients in the waiting area, the removal of shared objects, proper ventilation, and physical distancing were highly recommended. Psychological distress among dental professionals in relation to existing medical conditions and self-efficacy has been discussed. Conclusions: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the dental profession worldwide, our review highlights many practice management approaches to adopt the new norm. More research highlighting evidence-based safety practices and multisectoral collaboration is required to help dental professionals make informed decisions and make the profession safe, both for the patient and dental professionals. © 2020 by the authors.

Schools and institutions of higher education were impacted badly, resulting from the lockdowns and movement restrictions imposed by the governments of numerous countries. Students and faculty found themselves in virtual classrooms, with many caught unaware of what they needed to do, having to learn new things at lightning speed and feeling a sense of despair. While many online learners had frustrations and concerns regarding their online learning experience, there were those who had a good learning experience. The students’ observations and perceptions of the difficulties and opportunities they encountered in their online learning experience were assessed through grounded theory using textual thematic qualitative analysis of their reflective feedback. The findings reveal that most students had a good online learning experience and found that the academic continuity plans implemented by the universities were effective. The concerns that some students had with online learning were related to technological drawbacks such as poor internet connections, and personal concerns about academic ability and time management skills, among others.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. The experience of Malaysia suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound. © 2020 The Author(s)","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Prevention and control; Reproduction number; Transmission","Article; case fatality rate; control strategy; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; death; disease transmission; epidemic; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; epidemic; epidemiology; genetics; pandemic; physiology; prevention and control; COVID-19; Epidemics; Humans; Malaysia; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2"

These recessions are unique, caused initially by supply disruptions, largely due to government-imposed ‘stay-in-shelter lockdowns’. These have interacted with falling incomes and demand, declining exports (and imports), collapsing commodity prices, shrinking travel and tourism, decreasing remittances and foreign exchange shortages. Highlighting implications for employment, wellbeing and development, it argues that governments need to design comprehensive relief measures and recovery policies to address short-term problems. These should prevent cash-flow predicaments from becoming full-blown solvency crises. Instead of returning to the status quo ante, developing countries’ capacities and capabilities need to be enhanced to address long-term sustainable development challenges.

In this study Twenty vanillin derivatives together with monolaurin and tetrodotoxin were used as test sets to evaluate as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The Structure-based pharmacophore modelling approach was also performed using 5RE6, 5REX and 5RFZ in order to analyse the binding site and ligand–protein complex interactions. Results: The pharmacophore modelling mode of 5RE6 displayed two Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA) and one Hydrophobic (HY) interaction. Besides, the pharmacophore model of 5REX showed two HBA and two HY interactions. Finally, the pharmacophore model of 5RFZ showed three HBA and one HY interaction. Based on ligand-based approach, 20 Schiff-based vanillin derivatives, showed strong MPro inhibition activity. This was due to their good alignment and common features to PDB-5RE6. Similarly, monolaurin and tetrodotoxin displayed some significant activity against SARS-CoV-2. From structure-based approach, vanillin derivatives (1) to (12) displayed some potent MPro inhibition against SARS-CoV-2.

Stranded citizens appeal to their governments to embark on citizen repatriation missions. Between February and April 2020, the Government of Malaysia directed repatriation of its citizens from China, Iran, Italy and Indonesia. We describe the preparation and execution of the repatriation mission using chartered commercial aircraft. The mission objectives were to repatriate as many citizens based on aircraft capacity and prevent onboard transmission of the disease to flight personnel. Results: Five repatriation missions performed was led by the National Agency for Disaster Management (NADMA) with the Ministry of Health providing technical expertise. A total of 432 citizens were repatriated from the missions. The operations were divided into four phases: the pre-boarding screening phase, the boarding and in-flight phase, the reception phase and the quarantine phase. The commercial aircraft used were from two different commercial airlines. Each mission had flight crew members between 10 and 17 people. There were 82 positive cases detected among the repatriated citizens. There was a single positive case of a healthcare worker involved in the mission, based on the sample taken on arrival of the flight. There were no infections involving flight team members. Conclusion: Medical flight crew must be familiar with aircraft fittings that differ from one commercial airline to another as it influences infection control practices.

"Use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19: How good is the quality of randomized controlled trials?",2020,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094102074&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijid.2020.09.1470&partnerID=40&md5=17c8be75da4493074527037a21816c27","Objectives: We critically evaluated the quality of evidence and quality of harm reporting in clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Study design and setting: Scientific databases were systematically searched to identify relevant trials of HCQ/CQ for the treatment of COVID-19 published up to 10 September 2020. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tools for randomized trials and non-randomized trials of interventions were used to assess risk of bias in the included studies. A 10-item Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) harm extension was used to assess quality of harm reporting in the included trials. Results: Sixteen trials, including fourteen randomized trials and two non-randomized trials, met the inclusion criteria. The results from the included trials were conflicting and lacked effect estimates adjusted for baseline disease severity or comorbidities in many cases, and most of the trials recruited a fairly small cohort of patients. None of the clinical trials met the CONSORT criteria in full for reporting harm data in clinical trials. None of the 16 trials had an overall ‘low’ risk of bias, while four of the trials had a ‘high’, ‘critical’, or ‘serious’ risk of bias. Biases observed in these trials arise from the randomization process, potential deviation from intended interventions, outcome measurements, selective reporting, confounding, participant selection, and/or classification of interventions. Conclusion: In general, the quality of currently available evidence for the effectiveness of CQ/HCQ in patients with COVID-19 is suboptimal. The importance of a properly designed and reported clinical trial cannot be overemphasized amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and its dismissal could lead to poorer clinical and policy decisions, resulting in wastage of already stretched invaluable health care resources. © 2020 The Author(s)","Adverse events; Chloroquine; Coronavirus 2019; Harm reporting; Hydroxychloroquine","chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; coronavirus disease 2019; data quality assessment; drug efficacy; drug use; human; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; statistical bias; drug therapy; Chloroquine; COVID-19; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; SARS-CoV-2"

Some have reported increased viral transmission to healthcare workers during aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation. We report our experience with universal preoperative and preprocedural screening for COVID-19 in children requiring general anaesthesia with low risk of having the infection. Methods: This was a data review involving children aged < 18 years undergoing procedures under general anaesthesia in our institution from 18th March to 31st May 2020 and deemed low risk for COVID 19 infection, as defined by our institutional protocol. Confirmation of COVID-19 was by real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing. All patients were followed up 14 days post-swab. Results: Of the 66 children (median age 4.5 years, range 0–16.8) eligible for the study, 39 (60%) were male and infants (1–12 months) formed the largest group (n = 24, 36%). None were positive for COVID-19. On 14 day follow-up, none had symptoms related to COVID-19. Conclusion: Our study shows that low risk asymptomatic children with no history of contact with COVID-19 patients test negative on universal screening. Larger studies are required to ascertain the role of screening prior to procedures done under general anaesthesia. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Pediatric; Preoperative preparation; Screening","nucleic acid; adolescent; aerosol generating procedure; Article; child; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; female; follow up; general anesthesia; health care personnel; human; infant; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; newborn; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; preoperative care; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; screening; surgical patient; symptom; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; factual database; laboratory technique; pandemic; preschool child; procedures; prospective study; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Anesthesia, General; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Preoperative Care; Prospective Studies"

This study examines the changes in stroke epidemiology and care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Zanjan Province, Iran. Methods: This study is part of the CASCADE international initiative. From February 18, 2019, to July 18, 2020, we followed ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke hospitalization rates and outcomes in Valiasr Hospital, Zanjan, Iran. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model and an interrupted time series analysis (ITS) to identify changes in stroke hospitalization rate, baseline stroke severity [measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)], disability [measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)], presentation time (last seen normal to hospital presentation), thrombolytic therapy rate, median door-to-needle time, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality. We compared in-hospital mortality between study periods using Cox-regression model. Results: During the study period, 1,026 stroke patients were hospitalized. Stroke hospitalization rates per 100,000 population decreased from 68.09 before the pandemic to 44.50 during the pandemic, with a significant decline in both Bayesian [Beta: -1.034; Standard Error (SE): 0.22, 95% CrI: -1.48, -0.59] and ITS analysis (estimate: -1.03, SE = 0.24, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, we observed lower admission rates for patients with mild (NIHSS < 5) ischemic stroke (p < 0.0001). Although, the presentation time and door-to-needle time did not change during the pandemic, a lower proportion of patients received thrombolysis (-10.1%; p = 0.004). We did not see significant changes in admission rate to the stroke unit and in-hospital mortality rate; however, disability at discharge increased (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: In Zanjan, Iran, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted stroke outcomes and altered the delivery of stroke care. Observed lower admission rates for milder stroke may possibly be due to fear of exposure related to COVID-19. The decrease in patients treated with thrombolysis and the increased disability at discharge may indicate changes in the delivery of stroke care and increased pressure on existing stroke acute and subacute services. The results of this research will contribute to a similar analysis of the larger CASCADE dataset in order to confirm findings at a global scale and improve measures to ensure the best quality of care for stroke patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Disability; Epidemiology; Mortality; Outcome; Stroke; Stroke care","fibrinolytic agent; aged; Article; blood clot lysis; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; coronavirus disease 2019; disability; female; fibrinolytic therapy; hospital mortality; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; outcome assessment; pandemic; preliminary data; priority journal; Rankin scale; stroke patient; stroke unit; trend study; Bayes theorem; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; convalescence; epidemiology; Iran; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; time factor; time to treatment; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bayes Theorem; Brain Ischemia; COVID-19; Female; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Humans; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Intracranial Hemorrhages; Iran; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care; Recovery of Function; Stroke; Thrombolytic Therapy; Time Factors; Time-to-Treatment; Treatment Outcome"

Methods: Teaching and Learning (T&L) activities were conducted virtually on e-learning platforms. The students' experience and feedback were evaluated after 15 weeks. Results: We found that while students preferred face-to-face, physical teaching, they were able to adapt to the new norm of e-learning. More than 60% of the students agreed that pre-recorded lectures and viewing videos of practical sessions, plus answering short questions, were beneficial. Certain aspects, such as hands-on practical and clinical experience, could never be replaced. The e-learning and study-from-home environment accorded a lot of flexibility. However, students also found it challenging to focus because of distractions, lack of engagement and mental stress. Technical problems, such as poor Internet connectivity and limited data plans, also compounded the problem. Conclusion: We expect e-learning to prevail in future.

We showed that fewer outpatients attended the Fracture Clinic, for non-hip fractures, during lockdown; in contrast, no change in admissions for hip fractures was observed. This could be due to fewer outdoors falls, during lockdown. Purpose: Many countries implemented a lockdown to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored whether outpatient attendances to the Fracture Clinic for non-hip fragility fracture and inpatient admissions for hip fracture declined during lockdown, among adults aged 50 years and older, in a large secondary care hospital. Methods: In our observational study, we analysed the records of 6681 outpatients attending the Fracture Clinic, for non-hip fragility fractures, and those of 1752 inpatients, admitted for hip fracture, during the time frames of interest. These were weeks 1st to 12th in 2020 (“prior to lockdown”), weeks 13th to 19th in 2020 (“lockdown”) and corresponding periods over 2015 to 2019. We tested for differences in mean numbers (standard deviation (SD)) of outpatients and inpatients, respectively, per week, during the time frames of interest, across the years. Results: Prior to lockdown, in 2020, 63.1 (SD 12.6) outpatients per week attended the Fracture Clinic, similar to previous years (p value 0.338). During lockdown, 26.0 (SD 7.3) outpatients per week attended the Fracture Clinic, fewer than previous years (p value < 0.001); similar findings were observed in both sexes and age groups (all p values < 0.001). During lockdown, 16.1 (SD 5.6) inpatients per week were admitted for hip fracture, similar to previous years (p value 0.776). Conclusion: During lockdown, fewer outpatients attended the Fracture Clinic, for non-hip fragility fractures, while no change in inpatient admissions for hip fracture was observed. This could reflect fewer non-hip fractures and may inform allocation of resources during pandemic. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Fragility fracture; Hip fracture; Older adults; Secondary healthcare utilisation","adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; falling; female; fragility fracture; groups by age; hip fracture; hospital admission; hospital patient; human; lockdown; major clinical study; male; observational study; outpatient care; pandemic; priority journal; quarantine; secondary care center; time to treatment; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; fragility fracture; hip fracture; hospitalization; middle aged; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Hip Fractures; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoporotic Fractures; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral"

To enter host cells, the viral spike protein (S-protein) binds to its receptor, ACE2, and is then processed by TMPRSS2. Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated changes in the energy of the complex caused by mutations in each species, relative to human ACE2, and correlated these changes with COVID-19 infection data. We also analysed structural interactions to better understand the key residues contributing to affinity. We predict that mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2. Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of mammals, but few fish, birds or reptiles. Susceptible animals could serve as reservoirs of the virus, necessitating careful ongoing animal management and surveillance. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; protein binding; spike glycoprotein, SARS-CoV; animal; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; classification; genetics; human; mammal; metabolism; molecular docking; mutation; phylogeny; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Humans; Mammals; Molecular Docking Simulation; Mutation; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Phylogeny; Protein Binding; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus"

Utilizing quantile-on-quantile (QQ) estimation technique, we examine in what manner the quantiles of COVID-19 affect the quantiles of air pollution and vice versa. The primary findings confirm overall dependence between COVID-19 and air pollution. Empirical results exhibit a strong negative effect of COVID-19 on air pollution in New York, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania; especially at medium to higher quantiles, while New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, and Georgia show strong negative effect mainly at lower quantiles. Contrarily, COVID-19 positively affects air pollution in Pennsylvania at extreme lower quantiles. On the other side, air pollution predominantly caused to increase in the intensity of COVID-19 cases across all states except lower quantiles of Massachusetts, and extreme higher quantiles of Arizona and New Jersey, where this effect becomes less pronounced or negative. Concludingly, a rare positive fallout of COVID-19 is reducing environmental pressure, while higher environmental pollution causes to increase the vulnerability of COVID-19 cases. These findings imply that air pollution is at the heart of chronic diseases, therefore the state government should consider these asymmetric channels and introduce appropriate policy measures to reset and control atmospheric emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; COVID-19; Ozone O3 pollution; Quantile-on-quantile","ozone; asymmetry; atmospheric pollution; environmental fate; estimation method; health impact; pollution effect; air pollution; air quality; Arizona; Article; chronic disease; coronavirus disease 2019; fallout; Georgia (U.S.); human; Illinois; major clinical study; Massachusetts; New Jersey; New York; Pennsylvania; priority journal; Texas; United States; adverse event; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; pollution; virus pneumonia; Arizona; Georgia; Illinois; Massachusetts; New Jersey; New York [United States]; Pennsylvania; Texas; United States; Air Pollution; Arizona; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Pollution; Georgia; Humans; Illinois; Massachusetts; New Jersey; New York; Pandemics; Pennsylvania; Pneumonia, Viral; Texas"

The PLpro have significant functional implications in the innate immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection and considered an important antiviral target. Both proteases share strikingly similar USP fold with right-handed thumb–palm–fingers structural scaffold and conserved catalytic triad Cys-His-Asp/Asn. In this urgency situation of COVID-19 outbreak, there is a lack of in-vitro facilities readily available to test SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors in whole-cell assays. Therefore, we adopted an alternate route to identify potential USP2 inhibitor through integrated in-silico efforts. After an extensive virtual screening protocol, the best compounds were selected and tested. The compound Z93 showed significant IC50 value against Jurkat (9.67 μM) and MOTL-4 cells (11.8 μM). The binding mode of Z93 was extensively analyzed through molecular docking, followed by MD simulations, and molecular interactions were compared with SARS-CoV-2. The relative binding poses of Z93 fitted well in the binding site of both proteases and showed consensus π-π stacking and H-bond interactions with histidine and aspartate/asparagine residues of the catalytic triad. These results led us to speculate that compound Z93 might be the first potential chemical lead against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, which warrants in-vitro evaluations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Deubiquitination; Leukemia; SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro); Ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2)","Amino acids; Binding energy; Binding sites; Alternate routes; Carboxyl-terminal; Catalytic triad; In-vitro evaluation; Innate immune response; Molecular docking; Relative binding; Virtual Screening; Papain; 3C-like proteinase, SARS-CoV-2; antivirus agent; ubiquitin thiolesterase; USP2 protein, human; chemical structure; chemistry; drug effect; drug therapy; enzymology; human; Jurkat cell line; metabolism; molecular model; pharmacology; preclinical study; tumor cell line; virology; Antiviral Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Coronavirus 3C Proteases; Coronavirus Protease Inhibitors; COVID-19; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; Jurkat Cells; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; SARS-CoV-2; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase"

In this study, we describe the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical training in Southeast Asia. Methods: We conducted an online survey among neurosurgery residents in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand from May 22 to 31, 2020 using Google Forms. The 33-item questionnaire collected data on elective and emergency neurosurgical operations, ongoing learning activities, and health worker safety. Results: A total of 298 of 470 neurosurgery residents completed the survey, equivalent to a 63% response rate. The decrease in elective neurosurgical operations in Indonesia and in the Philippines (median, 100% for both) was significantly greater compared with other countries (P < 0.001). For emergency operations, trainees in Indonesia and Malaysia had a significantly greater reduction in their caseload (median, 80% and 70%, respectively) compared with trainees in Singapore and Thailand (median, 20% and 50%, respectively; P < 0.001). Neurosurgery residents were most concerned about the decrease in their hands-on surgical experience, uncertainty in their career advancement, and occupational safety in the workplace. Most of the residents (n = 221, 74%) believed that the COVID-19 crisis will have a negative impact on their neurosurgical training overall. Conclusions: An effective national strategy to control COVID-19 is crucial to sustain neurosurgical training and to provide essential neurosurgical services. Training programs in Southeast Asia should consider developing online learning modules and setting up simulation laboratories to allow trainees to systematically acquire knowledge and develop practical skills during these challenging times. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Global neurosurgery; Neurosurgery education; Neurosurgery training; Southeast Asia","Article; career; coronavirus disease 2019; e-learning; elective surgery; emergency surgery; health care personnel; health survey; human; Indonesia; Malaysia; neurosurgery; occupational safety; Philippines; questionnaire; resident; Singapore; Southeast Asia; surgical training; Thailand; workplace; diagnosis; education; emergency; epidemiology; health personnel attitude; medical education; neurosurgery; occupational health; prevention and control; protective equipment; research; telemedicine; Asia, Southeastern; Attitude of Health Personnel; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Education, Distance; Education, Medical, Graduate; Elective Surgical Procedures; Emergencies; Humans; Indonesia; Internship and Residency; Malaysia; Neurosurgery; Neurosurgical Procedures; Occupational Health; Personal Protective Equipment; Philippines; Research; Singapore; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; Thailand"

Methods: An online questionnaire was distributed to cytopathology laboratories in 24 Asia-Pacific countries to explore the impact of restrictive measures on access to health care, use of general and personal protective equipment (PPE), and changes in cytology workflow and workload from February to April 2020. Results: A total of 167 cytopathology laboratories from 24 countries responded to the survey; the majority reported that restrictive measures that limited the accessibility of health care services had been implemented in their cities and/or countries (80.8%) and their hospitals (83.8%). The respondents noted that COVID-19 had an impact on the cytologic workflow as well as the workload. Approximately one-half of the participants reported the implementation of new biosafety protocols (54.5%) as well as improvements in laboratory facilities (47.3%). Rearrangement or redeployment of the workforce was reported in 53.3% and 34.1% of laboratories, respectively. The majority of the respondents reported a significant reduction (>10%) in caseload associated with both gynecological (82.0%) and nongynecological specimens (78.4%). Most laboratories reported no significant change in the malignancy rates of both gynecological (67.7%) and nongynecological specimens (58.7%) compared with the same period in 2019. Conclusions: The results of the survey demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cytology specimens examined along with the need to implement new biosafety protocols.

Methods: We systematically reviewed the published studies to assess the association of RAS inhibitors with mortality as well as disease severity in COVID-19 patients. A systematic literature search was performed to retrieve relevant original studies investigating mortality and severity (severe/critical disease) in COVID-19 patients with and without exposure to RAS inhibitors. Results: A total of 59 original studies were included for qualitative synthesis. Twenty-four studies that reported adjusted effect sizes (24 studies reported mortality outcomes and 16 studies reported disease severity outcomes), conducted in RAS inhibitor–exposed and unexposed groups, were pooled in random-effects models to estimate overall risk. Quality assessment of studies revealed that most of the studies included were of fair quality. The use of an ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients was significantly associated with lower odds (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56–0.95; n = 18,749) or hazard (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.95; n = 26,598) of mortality compared with non-use of ACEI/ARB. However, the use of an ACEI/ARB was non-significantly associated with lower odds (OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.75–1.10; n = 7446) or hazard (HR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.33–1.66; n = 6325) of developing severe/critical disease compared with non-use of an ACEI/ARB. Discussion: Since there was no increased risk of harm, the use of RAS inhibitors for hypertension and other established clinical indications can be maintained in COVID-19 patients. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; adult; aged; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; hospital patient; human; intensive care unit; major clinical study; meta analysis; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; priority journal; prospective study; qualitative analysis; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; retrospective study; Review; systematic review; drug effect; hypertension; observational study; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; severity of illness index; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; COVID-19; Humans; Hypertension; Observational Studies as Topic; Renin-Angiotensin System; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of Illness Index"

Headache has been observed as one of the clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of headache in COVID-19 patients. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify studies published between December 2019 and March 2020. Adult (≥18 years) COVID-19 patients were considered eligible. We used random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Quality assessment was done using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020182529). Results: We identified 2,055 studies, of which 86 studies (n = 14,275, 49.4% female) were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of headache in COVID-19 patients was 10.1% [95% CI: 8.76–11.49]. There was no significant difference of headache prevalence in severe or critical vs. non-severe (RR: 1.05, p = 0.78), survived (recovered or discharged) vs. non-survived (RR: 1.36, p = 0.23), and ICU vs. non-ICU (RR: 1.06, p = 0.87) COVID-19 patients. We detected 64.0, 34.9, and 1.1% of the included studies as high, moderate, and low quality, respectively.

The number of kratom users outside of Southeast Asia has increased significantly in recent decades with use spreading to the Unites States (US) and Europe. Because of its reputed opioid-like psychoactive effects at higher doses, kratom has been regulated in several countries and is subject to an import ban by the US Food and Drug Administration. Nonetheless, in the US it is estimated that 10–15 million people consume kratom primarily for the self-treatment of pain, psychiatric disorders, to mitigate withdrawal from or dependence on opioids, and to self-treat opioid use disorder or other substance use disorders (SUDs). Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage in the supply of kratom products may place unexpected burdens on kratom users, potentially influencing some who use kratom for SUD self-treatment to regress to harmful drug use, hence increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes, including overdose. Inadequate treatment, treatment barriers, and increases in the sales of adulterated kratom products on the internet or in convenience stores could exacerbate circumstances further. Although there are currently no verified indications of kratom scarcity, researchers and clinicians should be aware of and remain vigilant to this unanticipated possibility. © Copyright © 2020 Singh, Brown, Cinosi, Corazza, Henningfield, Garcia-Romeu, McCurdy, McMahon, Prozialeck, Smith, Swogger, Veltri, Walsh and Grundmann.","COVID-19; kratom; OUD; SUD; withdrawal","Mitragyna speciosa extract; plant extract; unclassified drug; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; drug dependence; drug dependence treatment; drug fatality; drug overdose; drug use; harm reduction; human; mental disease; mental stress; Mitragyna speciosa; pain; self care; withdrawal syndrome"

This scenario in a way increased the rubber solid waste disposal problem; therefore, the production of biodegradable gloves may be an option to overcome this problem. However, the need to study the shelf life of biodegradable gloves is crucial before commercialization. There are well-established models to address the failure properties of gloves as stated in the American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) D7160. In this study, polysaccharide-based material-filled natural rubber latex (PFNRL) gloves, which are biodegradable gloves, were subjected to an accelerated aging process at different temperatures of 50−80 °C for 1−120 days. Prediction models based on Arrhenius and shift factors were used to estimate the shelf life of the PFNRL gloves. Based on the results obtained, the estimated time for the PFNRL gloves to retain 75% of their tensile strength at shelf temperature (30 °C) based on Arrhenius and shift factor models was 2.8 years. Verification on the activation energy based on the shift factor model indicated that the shelf life of PFNRL gloves is 2.9 years, which is only a 3.6% difference. The value obtained is aligned with the requirement in accordance with ASTM D7160, which states that only up to a maximum of 3 years’ shelf life is allowed for the gloves under accelerated aging conditions. © 2020 American Chemical Society",,

To curb the spread of the virus, many governments limited the movement of people or imposed full ‘lockdowns’. This created significant challenges for social workers practising with people often reliant on interpersonal support such as those at risk of domestic abuse; with mental health problems or learning disabilities. Measures to reduce viral spread affected the education sector at all levels from pre-school to higher education, disrupted traditional classroom pedagogy and shifted to technologically supported e-learning to minimise disruption to the students’ education. In lockdown, online teaching has become the new norm. E-learning has its limitations for professional curricula such as social work. Like most countries, field practice represents a compulsory component of the social work curriculum in Malaysia which measures the capabilities or competency of students to enable them to become qualified social workers. When COVID-19 forced universities and agencies to halt field placements in Malaysia, the immediate challenge was to find alternative ways of assessing students. This paper aims to provide an overview of field education assessment in Malaysia during the pandemic and to pose questions for future assessment as Malaysian social work drives towards increased professional regulation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; field practice; Malaysia; social work education; social work teaching and learning",

We aimed to examine the psychological impact of the MCO among clinical undergraduates. A cross-sectional study was conducted using self-reported questionnaires that were distributed online using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS 21), Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS), and the newly designed MCO effect questionnaire. Seven hundred seventy-two students completed the survey. The prevalence of psychological distress was 52.8%, with around 60% of respondents reporting disruption to their daily lives. Older (p = 0.015) and more senior students (p < 0.001) were less likely to be anxious than their younger and junior counterparts, respectively. A greater number of social support (three or more) was linked to a lower score of depression (p = 0.005) and stress (p = 0.045). Undergraduates who received family support demonstrated lower depression scores (p = 0.037) and higher mental wellbeing (p = 0.020) compared to those without. Government support was independently associated with a lesser risk of depressive symptoms (Adjusted odds ratio, AOR 0.68; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.47–0.99) and a greater sense of mental wellbeing (AOR 1.54; 95% CI 1.06–2.22). The present finding provides evidence of a high prevalence of psychological distress among clinical undergraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate social support is important in alleviating anxiety and stress and promoting greater mental wellbeing amongst students during the nationwide quarantine. © 2020 by the authors.

This is because most of the universities postponed the physical attendance at universities and used technology tools to keep the communication among the academic staff and students. ICT allows for the rapid search, access, and retrieval of information and collaboration between employees, while ICT infrastructure refers to the equipment, software, communication systems, and the human component such as experience, skills, command, principles. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of ICT and ICT infrastructure on Knowledge Sharing among academic staff. The study was conducted at nine Iraqi public universities located in Baghdad and the sample was the academic staff at these universities. The study employed the stratified sample method to ensure equal distribution among the nine universities, and the data was collected using the questionnaire. Structural equation modelling was utilized to analyze 267 valid questionnaires. After testing the measurement model and ensuring the model fit, the study examined the structural model to find the results. The result showed that ICT and ICT infrastructure had positive and significant impact on Knowledge Sharing among the academic staff at Iraqi public universities. However, the result indicated the Knowledge Sharing was highly impacted by ICT infrastructure.

Malaysia reported its first imported case on 25th January 2020, and adopted a policy of extensive contact tracing and hospitalising of all cases. We describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases nationwide and determine the risk factors associated with disease severity. Method: Clinical records of all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases aged ≥12 years admitted to 18 designated hospitals in Malaysia between 1st February and 30th May 2020 with complete outcomes were retrieved. Epidemiological history, co-morbidities, clinical features, investigations, management and complications were captured using REDCap database. Variables were compared between mild and severe diseases. Univariate and multivariate regression were used to identify determinants for disease severity. Findings: The sample comprised of 5889 cases (median age 34 years, male 71.7%). Majority were mild (92%), and 3.3% required intensive care, with 80% admitted within the first five days. Older age (≥51 years), underlying chronic kidney disease and chronic pulmonary disease, fever, cough, diarrhoea, breathlessness, tachypnoea, abnormal chest radiographs and high serum CRP (≥5 mg/dL) on admission were significant determinants for severity (p<0.05). The case fatality rate was 1.2%, and the three commonest complications were liver injuries (6.7%), kidney injuries (4%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (2.3%). Interpretations: Lower case fatality rate was possibly contributed by young cases with mild diseases and early hospitalisation. Abnormal chest radiographic findings in elderly with tachypnoea require close monitoring in the first five days to detect early deterioration. © 2020",,

About 33% were associated with a Tablighi Jamaat religious mass gathering held in Kuala Lumpur between February 27 and March 3, 2020, which drove community transmission during Malaysia’s second wave. We analysed genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Malaysia to better understand the molecular epidemiology and spread. We obtained 58 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences from patients in Kuala Lumpur and performed phylogenetic anal-yses on these and a further 57 Malaysian sequences available in the GISAID database. Nine different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.36, B.2, B.3 and B.6) were detected in Malaysia. The B.6 lineage was first reported a week after the Tablighi mass gathering and became predominant (65.2%) despite being relatively rare (1.4%) glob-ally. Direct epidemiological links between lineage B.6 viruses and the mass gathering were identified. Increases in reported total cases, Tablighi-associated cases, and community-acquired B.6 lineage strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 lineages were mainly travel-associated and showed limited onward transmission. There were also temporally correlated increases in B.6 sequences in other Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia, linked to participants returning from this event. Over 95% of global B.6 sequences originated from Asia Pacific. We also report a nsp3-C6310A substitution found in 47.3% of global B.6 sequences which was associated with reduced sensitivity using a commercial diagnostic real-time PCR assay. Lineage B.6 became the predominant cause of community transmission in Malaysia after likely introduction during a religious mass gathering. This event also contributed to spikes of lineage B.6 in other countries in the Asia-Pacific. Mass gatherings can be significant causes of local and global spread of COVID-19. Shared genomic surveillance can be used to identify SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains to aid prevention and control, and to monitor diagnostic molecular assays.

This study aimed to investigate the factors that affected a student’s acceptance of YouTube as learning resources. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study investigated the role of subscription status as a moderator variable. The data were collected during the Movement Control Order (MCO) that was placed on Malaysians, involving 340 students of a distance education program. The findings of this study supported TAM, in which the student’s acceptance towards YouTube as learning resources was related to the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and social influence. This study also reported that the subscription status did not moderate the relationship between the factors and the student’s acceptance. Therefore, this study implies that students accept YouTube as learning resources either as a subscriber of the YouTube channel or otherwise.

"Battling covid-19 pandemic waves in six south-east asian countries: A real-time consensus review",2020,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096380539&partnerID=40&md5=dd7d40f63acdd1221880b754c2906ca0","Introduction: COVID-19 has caused unprecedented public health concerns, triggering an escalated burden to health systems worldwide. The pandemic has altered people’s living norms, yet coherently escalating countries’ socio-economic instability. This real-time consensus review aims to describe the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 pandemic across six South-East Asian nations, and country-specific experiences on pandemic preparedness, responses and interventions. Methods: Consensus-driven approach between authors from the six selected countries was applied. Country specific policy documents, official government media statements, mainstream news portals, global statistics databases and latest published literature available between January-October 2020 were utilised for information retrieval. Situational and epidemiological trend analyses were conducted. Country-specific interventions and challenges were described. Based on evidence appraised, a descriptive framework was considered through a consensus. The authors subsequently outlined the lessons learned, challenges ahead and interventions that needs to be in place to control the pandemic. Results: The total number of people infected with COVID-19 between 1 January and 16 November 2020 had reached 48,520 in Malaysia, 58,124 in Singapore, 3,875 in Thailand, 470,648 in Indonesia, 409,574 in Philippines and 70,161 in Myanmar. The total number of people infected with COVID-19 in the six countries from January to 31 October 2020 were 936,866 cases and the mortality rate was 2.42%. Indonesia had 410,088 cases with a mortality rate of 3.38%, Philippines had 380,729 cases with a mortality rate of 1.90%, Myanmar had 52,706 cases with a mortality rate of 2.34%, Thailand had 3,780 cases with a mortality rate of 1.56%, Malaysia had 31,548 cases with a mortality rate of 0.79%, and Singapore had 58,015 cases with a mortality rate of 0.05% over the 10-month period. Each country response varied depending on its real-time situations based on the number of active cases and economic situation of the country. Conclusion: The number of COVID-19 cases in these countries waxed and waned over the 10-month period, the number of cases may be coming down in one country, and vice versa in another. Each country, if acting alone, will not be able to control this pandemic. Sharing of information and resources across nations is the key to successful control of the pandemic. There is a need to reflect on how the pandemic affects individuals, families and the community as a whole. There are many people who cannot afford to be isolated from their families and daily wage workers who cannot afford to miss work. Are we as a medical community, only empathising with our patients or are we doing our utmost to uphold them during this time of crisis? Are there any other avenues which can curb the epidemic while reducing its impact on the health and socio-economic condition of the individual, community and the nation?. © 2020, Malaysian Medical Association.

Therefore, the main objectives of this research are (1) to contextually understand the university interns' perception of ICT Techs (MALL, Gamification, and VR) in teaching English for secondary school students during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Malaysia, and (2) to determine which of these ICT Techs (MALL, Gamification, and VR) would be most preferred by the interns for teaching English to secondary school students in Malaysia. The research design for this study was quantitative and a web-based questionnaire was adapted from three articles (Mihaela Badea, 2015; Huseyin Oz, 2015; and Ali Rahimi, Niloofar Seyed Golshan & Hooman Mohebi, 2013). The reliability test indicated a value of 0.866 with Cronbach's Alpha reliability statistic. From a total of 63 university interns selected from a private university in Malaysia, the results indicated that 38.1% chose MALL, 33% chose Gamification, and 29% chose VR, as their preferred technology to teach English for secondary school students during this Covid-19 Pandemic in Malaysia. Evidence suggested that online learning can be more effective for students where they can control their own learning pace, compared to learning in a classroom environment. Thus, future English teachers should explore and apply innovative pedagogical methods in the teaching-learning process during pandemic outbreak in Malaysia, while contributing to the development of motivation, participation, and engagement among secondary school students in acquiring the English language. © 2020 by authors.","COVID-19 Pandemic; English Language; Gamification; MALL; Secondary School Students; VR",

Identifying people’s preferences is key to building public confidence and planning for successful national health intervention strategies. Objective: This study examines the sources of information for COVID-19 used by the Malaysian public and identifies those that are associated with building public confidence and positive perceptions toward the Malaysian government. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 4850 Malaysian residents was conducted. Participant demographics, media use, information sources, and attitudes surrounding COVID-19 were assessed. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to gauge the relationship between demographics, information sources, and attitudes toward COVID-19. Results: Malaysians primarily used television and internet news portals to access information on COVID-19. The Malaysian Ministry of Health was the most preferred source of COVID-19 information. Respondents who referred to the Ministry of Health, television, and the Malaysian National Security Council for information were more likely to believe that the country could win the battle against COVID-19 and that the government was handling the health crisis well compared to those who referred to other information sources. Those who used the World Health Organization, friends, YouTube, family, and radio as sources of information were less likely to harbor confidence and positive belief toward combating COVID-19. Conclusions: Managing information and sustaining public confidence is important during a pandemic. Health authorities should pay considerable attention to the use of appropriate media channels and sources to allow for more effective dissemination of critical information to the public. ©Emma Mohamad, Jen Sern Tham, Suffian Hadi Ayub, Mohammad Rezal Hamzah, Hasrul Hashim, Arina Anis Azlan.","Confidence; COVID-19; Government; Information source; Malaysia; Media; Online information; Social media; Survey","access to information; adult; aged; Article; attitude to health; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; data analysis software; demography; family; female; friend; government; health survey; human; information dissemination; Internet; Malaysia; male; mass medium; pandemic; perception; radio; social media; World Health Organization; attitude; epidemiology; pathogenicity; questionnaire; Adult; Attitude; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires"

Common barriers to the implementation of telemedicine included a lack of technological literacy, concerns with reimbursement, and resistance to changes in the workplace. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic declared in March 2020, the delivery of urological services globally has quickly shifted to telemedicine to account for the mass clinical, procedural, and operative cancellations, inadequate personal protective equipment, and shortage of personnel. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate current telemedicine usage by urologists, urologists’ perceptions on the necessity of in-person clinic appointments, the usability of telemedicine, and the current barriers to its implementation. Methods: We conducted a global, cross-sectional, web-based survey to investigate the use of telemedicine before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists’ perceived usability of telemedicine was assessed using a modified Delphi approach to create questions based on a modified version of the validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). For the purposes of this study, telemedicine was defined as video calls only. Results: A total of 620 urologists from 58 different countries and 6 continents participated in the survey. Prior to COVID-19, 15.8% (n=98) of urologists surveyed were using telemedicine in their clinical practices; during the pandemic, that proportion increased to 46.1% (n=283). Of the urologists without telemedicine experience, interest in telemedicine usage increased from 43.7% (n=139) to 80.8% (n=257) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among urologists that used telemedicine during the pandemic, 80.9% (n=244) were interested in continuing to use it in their practice. The three most commonly used platforms were Zoom, Doxy.me, and Epic, and the top three barriers to implementing telemedicine were patients’ lack of technological comprehension, patients’ lack of access to the required technology, and reimbursement concerns. Conclusions: This is the first study to quantify the use, usability, and pervading interest in telemedicine among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of this pandemic, urologists’ usage of telemedicine nearly tripled, demonstrating their ability to adopt and adapt telemedicine into their practices, but barriers involving the technology itself are still preventing many from utilizing it despite increasing interest. ©Justin M Dubin, W Austin Wyant, Navin C Balaji, William LK Ong, Reda H Kettache, Malik Haffaf, Skander Zouari, Diego Santillan, Ana Maria Autrán Gómez, Hossein Sadeghi-Nejad, Stacy Loeb, James F Borin, Juan Gomez Rivas, Jeremy Grummet, Ranjith Ramasamy, Jeremy Y C Teoh.","Barrier; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Cross-sectional; Implementation; Perception; Technology; Telehealth; Telemedicine; Urology; Usability","adult; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; female; human; male; middle aged; procedures; questionnaire; telemedicine; urologist; Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; Urologists"

Drawing on these qualitative reports, we highlight the similarities and discrepancies in access to services for PWUD in 16 countries under COVID-10 restrictions. In most countries reported here, efforts have been made to ensure continued access to services, such as mobilising opioid agonist maintenance treatment and other essential medicines to patients. However, due to travel restrictions and limited telemedicine services, several Network of Early Career Professionals working in Addiction Medicine members from lower-resourced countries experienced challenges with providing care to their patients during periods of COVID-19 lock-down.

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey (ECLB-COVID19) was launched on April 6, 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing. Methods The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online-survey-platform and was promoted by thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western-Asia and the Americas. All participants were asked for their mental wellbeing (SWEMWS) and depressive symptoms (SMFQ) with regard to ""during""and ""before""home confinement. Results Analysis was conducted on the first 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%). The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on both mental-wellbeing and on mood and feelings. Specifically, a significant decrease (p < .001 and Δ% = 9.4%) in total score of the SWEMWS questionnaire was noted. More individuals (+12.89%) reported a low mental wellbeing ""during""compared to ""before""home confinement. Furthermore, results from the mood and feelings questionnaire showed a significant increase by 44.9% (p < .001) in SMFQ total score with more people (+10%) showing depressive symptoms ""during""compared to ""before""home confinement. Conclusion The ECLB-COVID19 survey revealed an increased psychosocial strain triggered by the home confinement. To mitigate this high risk of mental disorders and to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL), a crisis-oriented interdisciplinary intervention is urgently needed. © 2020 Ammar et al.

Teachers are therefore required to adapt to, and update themselves on, the types of pedagogy needed to make teaching and learning attractive to students. However, the pandemic outbreak continues to threaten the education system and has closed schools worldwide. Consequently, the education system has changed dramatically, with teaching and learning increasingly being undertaken remotely on digital platforms. Video is one of the tools that can be used during this pandemic phase. This paper identifies secondary school students' perceptions of the use of video in teaching and learning. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Independent t-tests, and Pearson Correlation tests. The findings indicated that the majority of the respondents had positive perceptions of video usage in the classroom. These findings are useful for English teachers and may be useful for other educators in the same field. Because there are different types of students, this study will be beneficial in enabling educators to understand their students' preferences when learning English. Educators can also optimize the use of video to enhance their students' proficiency in the use of English. © 2020 Horizon Research Publishing.

Between all the countries that have reported the cases of patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), the United States of America has the highest number of infected people and mortality rate. Since different states in the USA reported different numbers of patients and also death cases, analyzing the difference ofSARS-CoV-2 between these states has great importance. Since the generated RNA walk from the SARS-CoV-2 genome includes complex random fluctuations that also contain information, in this study, we employ the complexity and information theories to investigate the variations of SARS-CoV-2 genome between different states in the USA for the first time. The results of our analysis showed that the fractal dimension and Shannon entropy of genome walk significantly change between different states. Based on these results, we can conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic structure significantly changes between different states, which is resulted from the virus evolution. Therefore, developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is very challenging since it should be able to fight various structures of the virus in different states. © 2020 The Author(s).","Complexity; COVID-19; Fractal Dimension; Information; SARS-CoV-2; Shannon Entropy; USA","Fractal dimension; Genes; Information theory; Viruses; Genomic structure; Human lives; Mortality rate; Random fluctuation; Shannon entropy; United States of America; Diseases"

A total of 983 students participated in a survey conducted online between April 20 and May 24, 2020. The psychological impact was measured using Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). The students were assessed on the usage of adaptive (humanitarian and seeking social support) and maladaptive coping strategies (acceptance and mental disengagement). The results showed that the students used maladaptive coping strategies more than adaptive coping strategies to deal with anxiety caused by the pandemic and the effect of restriction of movement. Seeking social support and acceptance coping strategies were significantly associated with the level of anxiety.

The infection spread rapidly in China and throughout the world, including Malaysia. Malaysia recorded its initial case on 25 January 2020 with intensifying numbers since March 2020. Due to this uncertain circumstance, Malaysia has introduced the Movement Control Order (MCO) with the main aim of isolating the source of the COVID-19 outbreak, which was effective from 18 March 2020. The restriction has observed fewer vehicles on the road with industrial and commercial activities being suspended. The objective of the study is to quantify the effects of MCO to food waste generation in town and district areas of Klang Valley, Malaysia. Food waste generation data was derived from the Project Delivery Department, KDEB Waste Management on a daily basis before (19 February–17 March 2020) and during the MCO (18 March–14 April 2020) at 12 local authorities in Selangor, Malaysia. The data was obtained with the limitation of assumption that there is no waste compositional analysis to be conducted in 2020. Despite the stay-at-home order, food waste data showed a descriptive reduction of up to 15.1% during the MCO. Statistical analysis of food waste generation from one-way variance has shown that municipal and district local authorities recorded a significant reduction (p < 0.50) during the MCO. The food waste reduction during the MCO will deliver as the evidence-based results to push the need for policies in Malaysia as per the goals outlined in Sustainable Development Goals of global food loss and waste. © 2020 by the authors.

This risk can be reduced by the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). However, shortage of PPE has emerged as an important issue in managing the pandemic in both traditionally high and low-resource areas. A group of clinicians and researchers from thirteen countries representing low, middle, and high-income areas has developed recommendations for optimal utilization of PPE before, during, and after gastrointestinal endoscopy with particular reference to low-resource situations. We determined that there is limited flexibility with regard to the utilization of PPE between ideal and low-resource settings. Some compromises are possible, especially with regard to PPE use, during endoscopic procedures. We have, therefore, also stressed the need to prevent transmission of COVID-19 by measures other than PPE and to conserve PPE by reduction of patient volume, limiting procedures to urgent or emergent, and reducing the number of staff and trainees involved in procedures.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the disease caused by the virus as COVID-19 and the virus which is the culprit was renamed from the initial novel respiratory 2019 coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2. The person-to-person transmission of this virus is ongoing despite drastic public health mitigation measures such as social distancing and movement restrictions implemented in most countries. Understanding the source of such an infectious pathogen is crucial to develop a means of avoiding transmission and further to develop therapeutic drugs and vaccines. To identify the etiological source of a novel human pathogen is a dynamic process that needs comprehensive and extensive scientific validations, such as observed in the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases. In this context, this review is devoted to understanding the taxonomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. Herein, we discuss the emergence and molecular mechanisms of both viral infections. Nevertheless, no vaccine or therapeutic drug is yet to be approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, although it is highly likely that new effective medications that target the virus specifically will take years to establish.

Due to that, the movement restriction has been enforced to contain this pandemic. Recently, there is an increasing pressure to restart and resurrect social and economic sectors, and to allow people to get back to work. This must be well planned before the movement restriction is lifted. Because of that, this paper aims to review and make recommendations on the new normal for our daily activities and works. Firstly, the social and economic sectors must be opening in phases by emphasizing safety and health than an economic recovery. In the meantime, the WHO recommendations on social distancing and personal hygiene must be adapted and become a new normal. Because of that, the government and local authorities should develop a soft landing approach based on the WHO recommendations. Next, the community must be engaged and empowered to do their parts in preventing the spread of COVID-19. From the new normal recommendations, the people can continue their daily routines, and at the same time can reduce COVID-19 transmission. However, medical possibilities are not considered while compiling these new normals and procedures.

As of May end, about 6 million people have been affected, and 367 166 have died from COVID-19. Recent studies suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares about 80% similarity with the SARS-CoV-1 while their protein RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) shares 96% sequence similarity. Remdesivir, an RdRp inhibitor, exhibited potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. 3-Chymotrypsin like protease (also known as Mpro) and papain-like protease, have emerged as the potential therapeutic targets for drug discovery against coronaviruses owing to their crucial role in viral entry and host-cell invasion. Crystal structures of therapeutically important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, namely, RdRp, Mpro, endoribonuclease Nsp15/NendoU and receptor binding domain of CoV-2 spike protein has been resolved, which have facilitated the structure-based design and discovery of new inhibitors. Furthermore, studies have indicated that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 use the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for its attachment similar to SARS-CoV-1, which is followed by priming of spike protein by Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which can be targeted by a proven inhibitor of TMPRSS2, camostat. The current treatment strategy includes repurposing of existing drugs that were found to be effective against other RNA viruses like SARS, MERS, and Ebola.

We systematically reviewed mortality in COVID-19 patients with ARDS and the potential role of systemic corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Electronic databases and country-specific healthcare databases were searched to identify relevant studies/reports. The quality assessment of individual studies was conducted using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Country-specific proportion of individuals with COVID-19 who developed ARDS and reported death were combined in a random-effect meta-analysis to give a pooled mortality estimate of ARDS. Results: The overall pooled mortality estimate among 10,815 ARDS cases in COVID-19 patients was 39% (95% CI: 23–56%). The pooled mortality estimate for China was 69% (95% CI: 67–72%). In Europe, the highest mortality estimate among COVID-19 patients with ARDS was reported in Poland (73%; 95% CI: 58–86%) while Germany had the lowest mortality estimate (13%; 95% CI: 2–29%) among COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The median crude mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with reported corticosteroid use was 28.0% (lower quartile: 13.9%; upper quartile: 53.6%). Conclusions: The high mortality in COVID-19 associated ARDS necessitates a prompt and aggressive treatment strategy which includes corticosteroids. Most of the studies included no information on the dosing regimen of corticosteroid therapy, however, low-dose corticosteroid therapy or pulse corticosteroid therapy appears to have a beneficial role in the management of severely ill COVID-19 patients. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroids; mortality","corticosteroid; corticosteroid; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid therapy; drug pulse therapy; drug use; Germany; human; low drug dose; meta analysis; mortality; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; Poland; systematic review; systemic therapy; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult"

Dahu exhibited difficulty breathing, infections of lung, intestines, and nostrils, as revealed by computed tomography imaging and necropsy. Previous phylogenetic analyses showed bat coronavirus RaTG13 is closer to COVID-19 CoV compared to pangolin coronavirus.

The statements were categorised as pre-endoscopy, during endoscopy and postendoscopy addressing relevant areas of practice, such as screening, personal protective equipment, appropriate environments for endoscopy and infection control precautions, particularly in areas of high disease prevalence. Recommendations for testing of patients and for healthcare workers, appropriate locations of donning and doffing areas and social distancing measures before endoscopy are unique and not dealt with by any other guidelines. This international consensus using a modified Delphi method to produce a series of best practice recommendations to aid the safe resumption of endoscopy services globally in the era of COVID-19. ©","endoscopy; infectious disease","clinical practice; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; digestive tract endoscopy; evidence based practice; health care personnel; human; infection control; pandemic; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; safety procedure; social distancing; consensus; Coronavirus infection; cross infection; Delphi study; digestive tract endoscopy; female; follow up; incidence; international cooperation; male; occupational health; pandemic; patient safety; practice guideline; procedures; risk assessment; time factor; United States; virus pneumonia; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Infection; Delphi Technique; Endoscopy, Digestive System; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Internationality; Male; Occupational Health; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; United States"

To determine the policies and plans, the study of the relations between the distributions of the spread of this virus in other countries is critical. In this work, the distributions of the spread of Covid-19 in Unites States America, Spain, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, France, and Iran were compared and clustered using fuzzy clustering technique. At first, the time series of Covid-19 datasets in selected countries were considered. Then, the relation between spread of Covid-19 and population's size was studied using Pearson correlation. The effect of the population's size was eliminated by rescaling the Covid-19 datasets based on the population's size of USA. Finally, the rescaled Covid-19 datasets of the countries were clustered using fuzzy clustering. The results of Pearson correlation indicated that there were positive and significant between total confirmed cases, total dead cases and population's size of the countries. The clustering results indicated that the distribution of spreading in Spain and Italy was approximately similar and differed from other countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coronaviruses; Correlation; Covid-19; Fuzzy Clustering; Statistics","Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Correlation methods; Viruses; Clustering results; Coronaviruses; Fuzzy clustering method; Fuzzy clustering techniques; Pearson correlation; Rescaling; United kingdom; Unites state; Fuzzy clustering"

Within months, COronaVIrus Disease (COVID-19) has spread to almost every country. With its long incubation period and highly contagious characteristics, most countries have initiated lockdown and social distancing is the new norm in most societies. Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on 18 March 2020 when the cumulative COVID-19 cases were still below 800. Since then, MCO was extended several times and the latest phase of Recovery MCO (RMCO) will last until 31 August 2020. As seafood represents an important protein source, the aquaculture sector supports the livelihood of coastal communities in Malaysia, particularly those involved in micro- and small-scale fish farming activities. The emergence and spread of this pandemic severely disrupt market demand and supply chains of seafood industries. Therefore, this case report looks into the potential impacts of COVID-19 on the aquaculture sector of Malaysia. Then, the coping strategies implemented by Malaysia are highlighted and their potential effectiveness is discussed. Also, some useful recommendations are suggested to ensure the continuity and growth of the aquaculture sector. We believe that insights in this report are applicable to other sectors and countries with similar economic characteristics. © 2020 The Authors","Aquaculture; COVID-19; Lockdown; Malaysia; MCO",

It is not known for certain if there is an association between any pharmacological agent used for rheumatologic treatment, including biological and non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and an increased risk of COVID-19 acquisition or adverse outcomes from COVID-19, although these agents have been associated with an overall higher risk of infections. The pharmacological management of patients with a rheumatic disease without COVID-19 should currently follow usual treatment approaches. Individualized approaches to adjusting DMARD regimens in patients with documented COVID-19 seems prudent, with specific attention paid to the severity of the infection. Patients receiving antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine) may continue treatment with these agents. Treatment with sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, immunosuppressants and biological agents other than interluekin-6 receptor inhibitors and JAK inhibitors should be stopped or withheld. It should be reasonable to resume DMARD treatment when patients are no longer symptomatic and at least 2 weeks after documentation of COVID-19, although the decision should be individualized, preferably based on infection severity. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"abatacept; azathioprine; baricitinib; cyclosporine; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; hydroxychloroquine; leflunomide; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; salazosulfapyridine; tacrolimus; tocilizumab; tofacitinib; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; upadacitinib; adverse outcome; Article; clinical outcome; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; evidence based practice; human; infection risk; managed care; medical documentation; pandemic; rheumatic disease; risk assessment; risk factor; systematic review (topic)"

The disease is presently a major health concern in Ghana and the rest of the world. Although, human to human transmission dynamics has been established, not much research is done on the dynamics of the virus in the environment and the role human play by releasing the virus into the environment. Therefore, investigating the human-environment-human by use of mathematical analysis and optimal control theory is relatively necessary. The dynamics of COVID-19 for this study is segregated into compartments as: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Asymptomatic (A), Symptomatic (I), Recovered (R) and the Virus in the environment/surfaces (V). The basic reproduction number R0 without controls is computed. The application of Lyapunov's function is used to analyse the global stability of the proposed model. We fit the model to real data from Ghana in the time window 12th March 2020 to 7th May 2020, with the aid of python programming language using the least-squares method. The average basic reproduction number without controls, R0a, is approximately 2.68. An optimal control is formulated based on the sensitivity analysis. Numerical simulation of the model is also done to verify the analytic results. The admissible control set such as: effective testing and quarantine when boarders are opened, the usage of masks and face shields through media education, cleaning of surfaces with home-based detergents, practising proper cough etiquette and fumigating commercial areas; health centers is simulated in MATLAB. We used forward-backward sweep Runge-Kutta scheme which gave interesting results in the main text, for example, the cost-effectiveness analysis shows that, Strategy 4 (safety measures adopted by the asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals such as practicing proper coughing etiquette by maintaining a distance, covering coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing and washing of hands after coughing or sneezing) is the most cost-effective strategy among all the six control intervention strategies under consideration. © 2020","Cost-effectiveness analysis; COVID-19; Environmental transmission; Global stability; Optimal control; Sensitivity analysis","Cell proliferation; Cost effectiveness; Dynamics; Least squares approximations; MATLAB; Runge Kutta methods; Sensitivity analysis; Soaps (detergents); Viruses; Basic reproduction number; Cost effective strategies; Cost effectiveness analysis; Forward/ backward sweep; Human-to-human transmission; Mathematical analysis; Optimal control theory; Python programming language; Cost benefit analysis"

To deeply explore the said matter, we divide the economic impact into six dimensions that is, Chinese economy, Central Asian economies, South Asian economies, South East and West Asian economies, European economies, Northern African, and Middle Eastern economies. The paper concludes that epidemic situations like COVID-19 severely affect economies around the globe. The basic reasons behind such severity are immobility of labor, reduction in productivity, discontinuation of the supply chain, a decline in exports, uncertainty, and so on.

Methods: Urologists worldwide completed a Société Internationale d’Urologie online survey from 16 April 2020 until 1 May 2020. Analysis was carried out to evaluate their knowledge about protecting themselves and others in the workplace, including their confidence in their ability to remain safe at work, and any regional differences. Results: There were 3488 respondents from 109 countries. Urologists who stated they were moderately comfortable that their work environment offers good protection against coronavirus disease 2019 showed a total mean satisfaction level of 5.99 (on a “0 = not at all” to “10 = very” scale). A large majority (86.33%) were confident about protecting themselves from coronavirus disease 2019 at work. However, only about one-third reported their institution provided the required personal protective equipment (35.78%), and nearly half indicated their hospital has or had limited personal protective equipment availability (48.08%). Worldwide, a large majority of respondents answered affirmatively for testing the healthcare team (83.09%). Approximately half of the respondents (52.85%) across all regions indicated that all surgical team members face an equal risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (52.85%). Nearly one-third of respondents reported that they had experienced social avoidance (28.97%). Conclusions: Our results show that urologists lack up-to-date knowledge of preferred protocols for personal protective equipment selection and use, social distancing, and coronavirus disease 2019 testing.

We seek to systematically review the available evidence regarding the anticoagulation approach to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) among COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units. Electronic databases were searched for studies reporting venous thromboembolic events in patients admitted to the intensive care unit receiving any type of anticoagulation (prophylactic or therapeutic). The pooled prevalence (and 95% confidence interval [CI]) of VTE among patients receiving anticoagulant were calculated using the random-effects model. Subgroup pooled analyses were performed with studies reported prophylactic anticoagulation alone and with studies reported mixed prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation. We included twelve studies (8 Europe; 2 UK; 1 each from the US and China) in our systematic review and meta-analysis. All studies utilized LMWH or unfractionated heparin as their pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, either prophylactic doses or therapeutic doses. Seven studies reported on the proportion of patients with the previous history of VTE (range 0–10%). The pooled prevalence of VTE among ICU patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation across all studies was 31% (95% CI 20–43%). Subgroup pooled analysis limited to studies reported prophylactic anticoagulation alone and mixed (therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation) reported pooled prevalences of VTE of 38% (95% CI 10–70%) and 27% (95% CI 17–40%) respectively. With a high prevalence of thromboprophylaxis failure among COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units, individualised rather than protocolised VTE thromboprophylaxis would appear prudent at interim. © 2020, The Author(s).","Anticoagulation; Coronavirus 2019; COVID-19; Critically ill; Venous thromboembolism","heparin; low molecular weight heparin; anticoagulant agent; fibrinolytic agent; anticoagulant therapy; Article; China; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; hospital admission; human; intensive care unit; medical history; meta analysis; monotherapy; prevalence; priority journal; systematic review; thrombosis prevention; United Kingdom; United States; venous thromboembolism; aged; Betacoronavirus; blood; blood clotting; Coronavirus infection; critical illness; drug effect; female; host pathogen interaction; male; middle aged; pandemic; pathogenicity; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome; venous thromboembolism; virology; virus pneumonia; Aged; Anticoagulants; Betacoronavirus; Blood Coagulation; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Illness; Female; Fibrinolytic Agents; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Venous Thromboembolism"

Not only the rate and pattern of contagion that threaten our sense of healthy living but also the safety measures put in place for containing the spread of the virus may require social distancing. Three different measures to counteract this pandemic situation have emerged, namely: (i) vaccination, (ii) herd immunity development, and (iii) lockdown. As the first measure is not ready at this stage and the second measure is largely considered unreasonable on the account of the gigantic number of fatalities, a vast majority of countries have practiced the third option despite having a potentially immense adverse economic impact. To mitigate such an impact, this paper proposes a data-driven dynamic clustering framework for moderating the adverse economic impact of COVID-19 flare-up. Through an intelligent fusion of healthcare and simulated mobility data, we model lockdown as a clustering problem and design a dynamic clustering algorithm for localized lockdown by taking into account the pandemic, economic and mobility aspects. We then validate the proposed algorithms by conducting extensive simulations using the Malaysian context as a case study. The findings signify the promises of dynamic clustering for lockdown coverage reduction, reduced economic loss, and military unit deployment reduction, as well as assess potential impact of uncooperative civilians on the contamination rate. The outcome of this work is anticipated to pave a way for significantly reducing the severe economic impact of the COVID-19 spreading. Moreover, the idea can be exploited for potentially the next waves of corona virus-related diseases and other upcoming viral life-threatening calamities. © 2020","Covid-19; Dynamic clustering; Lockdown; Pandemic","Clustering algorithms; Losses; Reduction; Viruses; Clustering problems; Dynamic clustering; Dynamic clustering algorithm; Economic impacts; Extensive simulations; Intelligent fusion; Potential impacts; Safety measures; Economic and social effects"

A survey was conducted among the general public in Iran aimed at investigating psychobehavioural issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak, namely (a) barriers to preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) negative emotions towards SARS-CoV-2 infection; and (c) anxiety levels among the general public in Iran. A cross-sectional, web-based survey using an online questionnaire was carried out between 16 March and 1 April 2020. The six-item version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to assess anxiety levels. A total of 1,789 complete responses were received. Nearly 60% reported having difficulty in wearing a face mask to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total prevention barrier score was 35.8 (SD ± 7.1; range 18–68) out of a possible score of 72.

Thus, the transfusion of these antibodies to deteriorating patients could theoretically help boost their immune system. Biologically, two challenges need to be surmounted to allow convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue the most severe COVID-19 patients. First, convalescent subjects must meet donor selection plasma criteria and comply with national health requirements and known standard routine procedures. Second, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems should be considered in the selection of the most suitable CP and the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19. Objective: This paper presents a rescue framework for the transfusion of the best CP to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements by using machine learning and novel MCDM methods. Method: The proposed framework is illustrated on the basis of two distinct and consecutive phases (i.e. testing and development). In testing, ABO compatibility is assessed after classifying donors into the four blood types, namely, A, B, AB and O, to indicate the suitability and safety of plasma for administration in order to refine the CP tested list repository. The development phase includes patient and donor sides. In the patient side, prioritisation is performed using a contracted patient decision matrix constructed between ‘serological/protein biomarkers and the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fractional inspired oxygen criteria’ and ‘patient list based on novel MCDM method known as subjective and objective decision by opinion score method’. Then, the patients with the most urgent need are classified into the four blood types and matched with a tested CP list from the test phase in the donor side. Thereafter, the prioritisation of CP tested list is performed using the contracted CP decision matrix. Result: An intelligence-integrated concept is proposed to identify the most appropriate CP for corresponding prioritised patients with COVID-19 to help doctors hasten treatments. Discussion: The proposed framework implies the benefits of providing effective care and prevention of the extremely rapidly spreading COVID-19 from affecting patients and the medical sector. © 2020","Convalescent plasma therapy; COVID-19; Machine learning; MCDM; Protein biomarker; Serological; SODOSM","Antibodies; Behavioral research; Blood; Decision making; Oxygen; Safety testing; Arterial blood; Blood types; Coronaviruses; Decision matrices; Development phase; Health requirements; Multi-criteria decision making; Partial pressure of oxygen; Patient treatment; blood group antigen; oxygen; plasma protein; biological marker; plasma protein; virus antibody; arterial blood; Article; blood analysis; blood compatibility; blood group A; blood group AB; blood group B; blood group O; conceptual framework; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; donor selection; human; information processing; machine learning; methodology; multicriteria decision analysis; partial pressure; patient safety; plasma transfusion; screening test; Betacoronavirus; blood; blood group ABO system; clinical decision support system; Coronavirus infection; decision making; factual database; immunology; pandemic; passive immunization; virus pneumonia; ABO Blood-Group System; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; Blood Proteins; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Factual; Decision Making; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Machine Learning; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral"

Currently detection of coronovirus depends on factors like the patients' signs and symptoms, location where the person lives, travelling history and close contact with any COVID-19 patient. In order to test a COVID-19 patient, a healthcare provider uses a long swab to take a nasal sample. The sample is then tested in a laboratory setting. If person is coughing up then the saliva (sputum), is emitted for testing. The diagnosis becomes even more critical when there is a lack of reagents or testing capacity, tracking the virus and its severity and coming in contact with COVID-19 positive patients by a healthcare practitioner. In this scenario of COVID-19 pendamic, there is a need of streaming diagnosis based on retrospective study of laboratory data in form of chest X-rays using deep learning.

Based on the previously explored antiviral effects and phytochemical components of honey, we review here evidence for its role as a potentially effective natural product against COVID-19. Although some bioactive compounds in honey have shown potential antiviral effects (i.e., methylglyoxal, chrysin, caffeic acid, galangin and hesperidinin) or enhancing antiviral immune responses (i.e., levan and ascorbic acid), the mechanisms of action for these compounds are still ambiguous. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exclusively summarizing all these bioactive compounds with their probable mechanisms of action as antiviral agents, specifically against SARS-CoV-2.","2019-nCoV; antiviral activity; antiviral agent; antiviral immunity; SARS-CoV-2","antivirus agent; immunologic factor; phytochemical; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; forecasting; honey; human; isolation and purification; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Forecasting; Honey; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Pandemics; Phytochemicals; Pneumonia, Viral"

The virus is also known as an infectious disease inherited from a novel coronavirus. This study exposed the beginning of the unprecedented COVID-19 confirmed cases spike exponentially in the United States and 200 countries globally. Epidemiologists usually utilize conventional spread prediction via the classic clustering method. A suspected patient is likely to blow out the disease to a potential agglomerative of cases grouped in place and time. In the era of cutting edge, outbreak prediction can also generate accurate techniques to utilize unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply two prominent unsupervised learning methods, namely K-means clustering and correlation on a set Coronavirus Outbreak COVID-19 data collection dated March 27 and August 16, 2020. The K-means automatically search for unknown clusters of many countries infected with the COVID-19 rapidly. It shows that a group of $m = 5$ produces an accuracy of about 97% with [The United States and Italy], [Iran, France], [Spain, German], [Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippine] as clusters.

The diversity of themes identified in this paper can be grouped into the following categories of disease mapping: spatiotemporal analysis, health and social geography, environmental variables, data mining, and web-based mapping. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is essential for its mitigation, as it helps to clarify the extent and impact of the pandemic and can aid decision making, planning and community action. Health geography highlights the interaction of public health officials, affected actors and first responders to improve estimations of disease propagation and likelihoods of new outbreaks. Attempts at interdisciplinary correlation examine health policy interventions for the siting of health/sanitary services and controls, mapping/tracking of human movement, formulation of appropriate scientific and political responses and projection of spatial diffusion and temporal trends. This review concludes that, to fight COVID-19, it is important to face the challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective, with proactive planning, international solidarity and a global perspective. This review provides useful information and insight that can support future bibliographic queries, and also serves as a resource for understanding the evolution of tools used in the management of this major global pandemic of the 21 Century.

"Community engagement for COVID-19 prevention and control: A rapid evidence synthesis",2020,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093516890&doi=10.1136%2fbmjgh-2020-003188&partnerID=40&md5=fb8fa318deaf27f9094d16a0425b0c12","Introduction Community engagement has been considered a fundamental component of past outbreaks, such as Ebola. However, there is concern over the lack of involvement of communities and a € bottom-up' approaches used within COVID-19 responses thus far. Identifying how community engagement approaches have been used in past epidemics may support more robust implementation within the COVID-19 response. Methodology A rapid evidence review was conducted to identify how community engagement is used for infectious disease prevention and control during epidemics. Three databases were searched in addition to extensive snowballing for grey literature. Previous epidemics were limited to Ebola, Zika, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndromeand H1N1 since 2000. No restrictions were applied to study design or language. Results From 1112 references identified, 32 articles met our inclusion criteria, which detail 37 initiatives. Six main community engagement actors were identified: local leaders, community and faith-based organisations, community groups, health facility committees, individuals and key stakeholders. These worked on different functions: designing and planning, community entry and trust building, social and behaviour change communication, risk communication, surveillance and tracing, and logistics and administration. Conclusion COVID-19's global presence and social transmission pathways require social and community responses. This may be particularly important to reach marginalised populations and to support equity-informed responses. Aligning previous community engagement experience with current COVID-19 community-based strategy recommendations highlights how communities can play important and active roles in prevention and control. Countries worldwide are encouraged to assess existing community engagement structures and use community engagement approaches to support contextually specific, acceptable and appropriate COVID-19 prevention and control measures. ©","diseases; disorders; infections; injuries; prevention strategies; public health; review",

This virus has recorded above 21 Million infected cases and 750,000 deaths by early August 2020 [7]. As there is no cure and vaccine available yet, this unprecedented infectious virus is still claiming its toll on daily basis. The year 2020 will be remembered throughout the world for the pandemic and is the same in Malaysia too. Malaysia observed stringent movement control orders (MCO) by locking down the economy from March 18th, 2020. This has greatly reduced the carbon emissions by commercial/ educational entities throughout the country. At the same time, since people were required to stay home and the use of communication and work channels through digital platforms escalated, it has caused the surge in the residential network and energy demand to the peak. The online meetings and the Direct-to-Home (DTH) connections caused enormous load on the network infrastructure and the related energy surge. This study is an attempt to study the effects of pro-environmental behaviour and the Green IT practices during the lockdown period through applying the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). Our research indicated that the constructs of PMT has the significant capability to define the pro-environmental behaviour in the individuals. The PMT constructs, 'self-efficacy' and 'response-efficacy', along with the extrinsic and intrinsic rewards of intentions can derive pro-environmental behaviour in the given circumstances related to this study. © 2020 IEEE.","COVID- 19; Green IT; Pro-environmental behaviour; Protection Motivation Theory","Computation theory; Intelligent computing; Viruses; Carbon emissions; Digital platforms; Infectious virus; Intrinsic rewards; Movement control; Network infrastructure; Protection motivation theory; Residential networks; Green computing"

The unexpected outbreak and unchecked global spread of COVID19 indicate that the current global healthcare networks have limitations in addressing the crises for public safety. The detection of infected or tested patients globally is challenging when patients travel abroad. As such, innovative technology such as blockchain has emerged as a potential approach for addressing coronavirus patient tracking. Blockchain technology can tackle pandemics by allowing early detection of outbreaks, protecting individual privacy while maintaining data security by using smart contracts. Motivated by these facts, we propose a novel blockchain-based framework that integrates intercountry for COVID-19 to track infected or tested patients globally using the methodology of design science research.

Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory research has been informed by the broader social constructivism paradigm and the basics of grounded theory method to identify the common themes. Six semistructured interviews have been conducted with INGOs’ leaders. The findings have been categorized, triangulated and prioritized toward the final identification of benchmarks. Findings: Seven COVID-19 benchmarks for INGOs’ effective responses during COVID-19 pandemic have been proposed, comprising of (1) donors’ policies and regulations, (2) needs, expectations and relevancy, (3) coordination, (4) staff management, (5) business continuation plans, (6) balanced short-term and long-term planning and (7) permanent adoption of successful modalities. Social implications: INGOs play a vital role in the lives of vulnerable people around the world through their international development and aid (IDA) projects. However, the restrictions of movements associated with COVID-19 pandemic drive more burden on these communities and interrupted their access to assistance and support. This paper helps to sustain the crucial support of INGOs to those people who need it. Originality/value: COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted the implementation of IDA projects, which added further obstacles toward the achievement of quality implementation of these projects. The proposed COVID-19 benchmarks help INGOs to overcome the consequences of pandemic on the near longer-term alike. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business continuity; COVID-19; INGOs; International development and aid projects; Project complexities; Project management; Sustainable development goal",

University closures impact not only students, lecturers, and families, but have far-reaching economic and societal consequences. In response to that, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) has introduced the use of online distance learning and open educational applications and platforms that lecturers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education. Even though UiTM has already adopted the integrated face-to-face and online learning approach in the classroom since many years ago, however, the commencement of solely using online learning platforms, in the absence of face-to-face meetings is challenging. In addition, it is also crucial to note that the previous study on the determinants of the intention and effective use of online distance learning is scarce. Thus, this study seeks to identify the significant relationship between the intention and the effective use of an ODL among the students. Findings from this study reveals that four out of five determinants (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition and intrinsic value) found to be significantly related with the behavioral intention of the students to use online distance learning. Behavioral intention also was found to be significant with use behavior. Although the intrinsic values (new determinants) have contributed to the theory, it is recommended that the same study will be carried out to the entire education center, either public or private. © 2020.

Students, as the generation who will shape society in future, must be able to contribute ideas to resolve environmental problems. One of the abilities that must be acquired to do so is Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS). This can be trained by developing a Disaster Mitigation of Floods Based on Online Learning (DIFMOL) education model. This study aims to develop a DIFMOL model to improve students’ HOTS. The research method was adapted from Gall and Borg (2003). The results showed that all students had a very low score of HOTS (28.01), with the male level (28.02) being slightly higher than females (27.99). Meanwhile, the validation results showed that the DIFMOL model had a valid score. This suggested that the model may be used in learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The DIFMOL model is a technology-based 21st-century learning innovation. The study concludes that the students’ HOTS score was low and the DIFMOL model may be used to improve their skills. © 2020.

The present study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and precautionary practices of HCPs towards COVID-19. Methodology: The current study was a descriptive, cross-sectional, online study directed to the HCPs working in a metropolitan city of Karachi, during February 2020 and March 2020 using a self-administered questionnaire. A systematic random sampling approach was adopted. Results: A total of 286 completed surveys were incorporated in the investigation with a response rate of 74.28%. The median (interquartile range, IQR) knowledge score was 18.79 (17.64-19.57). Physicians were found to be more knowledgeable (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 0.17-4.26, p = 0.003) as compared to other HCPs. Similarly, the HCPs working in private work settings (OR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.54-2.79, p=0.001), having more experience (OR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.64-2.78; p < 0.005) were found to be more well-informed than HCPs working in public sector (OR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.63-0.72; p = 0.004). The correlation between the knowledge and attitude of respondents was found to be significantly correlated (correlation coefficient: 0.13, p < 0.005). Conclusions: The findings of the study revealed that HCPs were well conversant and have an optimistic attitude towards COVID-19. Further contemplates are required to evaluate the understanding of HCPs at a national level so that viable mediations could be planned to combat this pandemic. © 2020 Shakeel et al.

Efficient clinical management remains a challenge in combatting the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by this virulent strain. This contagious disease is new to the people of Bangladesh. The country is at high risk of spreading the coronavirus infection particularly because of its high population density. Significant morbidity and mortality have been observed for the quick transmission of this virus since March 8, 2020. The basic objective of this article is to analyze the preparedness of Bangladesh, given its constraints and limitations, to cope with the rapid spread of COVID-19 infection. In doing so, it summarizes the origin of coronavirus, epidemiology, mode of transmission, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of the disease. Although many steps have been taken by the Government and the private sector of Bangladesh to create awareness about measures needed to prevent the deadly infections, many people are unaware of and reluctant to accept the prescribed rules. Inadequacy of diagnostic facilities and limitations of clinical care and health care services were major constraints faced in treating COVID-19 infected people in Bangladesh. Greater compliance by the people in following the suggested measures may help reduce the rapid spread of the disease and overcome the challenges faced by this pandemic. © 2020 Islam et al.

COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact routes. Therefore, the ultimate decision for surgery, should be based on which is the safest, quickest route and concurrently ensuring that HCWs are protected during these surgeries. During the time of crisis, HCWs need to concentrate and channel resources to the care of those affected by the coronavirus hence judicious allocation of resources is mandatory. We present the guidelines and recommendations on gynecological laparoscopic surgery during this COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia. Materials and Methods: Thorough search of articles and recommendations were done to look into the characteristics of the virus in terms of transmission and risks during surgery. Smoke plume characteristics, composition and risk of viral transmission were also studied. Search includes The WHO Library, Cochrane Library and electronic databases (PubMed, Google scholar and Science Direct). Conclusion: We concluded that there is no scientific basis of shunning laparoscopic approach in surgical intervention. Ultimately, the guiding principles would be of reducing the anesthetic and surgical duration, the availability of full protective gear for HCWs during the surgery and the status of the patient. It is mandatory for viral swab tests to be done within the shortest window period possible, for all cases planned for surgery. © 2020 Gynecology and Minimally Invasive Therapy | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Aerosolization; laparoscopy; safety; transmission","anesthetic agent; aerosol; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; female; gynecologic surgery; health care personnel; human; laparoscopic surgery; Malaysia; medical society; nonhuman; pandemic; plume; practice guideline; priority journal; smoke; surgical approach; surgical risk; virus transmission"

This study aims to estimate the level of doctors’ fatigue, recovery, depression, anxiety, and stress, and exploring their association with work demands and recovery experiences. This was a cross-sectional study among all medical doctors working at all government health facilities in Selangor, Malaysia. Data were collected in May 2020 immediately following the COVID-19 contagion peak in Malaysia by using self-reported questionnaires through an online medium. The total participants were 1050 doctors. The majority of participants were non-resident non-specialist medical officers (55.7%) and work in the hospital setting (76.3%). The highest magnitude of work demands was mental demand (M = 7.54, SD = 1.998) while the lowest magnitude of recovery experiences was detachment (M = 9.22, SD = 5.043). Participants reported a higher acute fatigue level (M = 63.33, SD = 19.025) than chronic fatigue (M = 49.37, SD = 24.473) and intershift recovery (M = 49.97, SD = 19.480). The majority of them had no depression (69.0%), no anxiety (70.3%), and no stress (76.5%). Higher work demands and lower recovery experiences were generally associated with adverse mental health. For instance, emotional demands were positively associated with acute fatigue (adj. b = 2.73), chronic fatigue (adj. b = 3.64), depression (adj. b = 0.57), anxiety (adj. b = 0.47), and stress (adj. b = 0.64), while relaxation experiences were negatively associated with acute fatigue (adj. b = −0.53), chronic fatigue (adj. b = −0.53), depression (adj. b = −0.14), anxiety (adj. b = −0.11), and stress (adj. b = −0.15). However, higher detachment experience was associated with multiple mental health parameters in the opposite of the expected direction such as higher level of chronic fatigue (adj. b = 0.74), depression (adj. b = 0.15), anxiety (adj. b = 0.11), and stress (adj. b = 0.11), and lower level of intershift recovery (adj. b = −0.21). In conclusion, work demands generally worsen, while recovery experiences protect mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic with the caveat of the role of detachment experiences. © 2020, MDPI AG.

This study evaluated temporal and spatial variations of four major air pollutant concentrations across Malaysia before (March 4, 2020–March 17, 2020) and during the implementation of different phases of Movement Control Order (MCO) (March 18, 2020–May 12, 2020) from 65 official regulatory air quality stations. Results showed that restriction in daily and economic activities has remarkably reduced the air quality in all sub-urban, urban, and industrial settings with relatively small contributions from meteorological conditions. Overall, compared to before MCO, average concentrations of PM2.5, CO, and NO2 reduced by 23.1%, 21.74%, and 54.0%, respectively, while that of SO2 was constant. The highest reduction of PM2.5, CO, and NO2 were observed in stations located in urban setting, where 63% stations showed significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) for PM2.5 and CO, while all stations showed significant reduction in NO2 concentrations. It was also revealed that 70.5% stations recorded lower concentrations of PM2.5 during MCO compared to before MCO, despite that high numbers of local hotspots were observed simultaneously from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Spatial analysis showed that the northern part of Peninsular had the highest significant reduction of PM2.5, while the highest of NO2 and CO reduction were found in stations located in the central region. All pollutants exhibit similar diurnal trends when compared between pre-and during MCO although significant lower readings were observed during MCO.

Unfortunately, there are very limited approved drugs available with established efficacy against the SARs-CoV-2 virus and its inflammatory complications. Vaccine development is actively being researched, but it may take over a year to become available to general public. Certain medications, for example, dexamethasone, antimalarials (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine), antiviral (remdesivir), and IL-6 receptor blocking monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab), are used in various combinations as off-label medications to treat COVID-19. Essential oils (EOs) have long been known to have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, bronchodilatory, and antiviral properties and are being proposed to have activity against SARC-CoV-2 virus. Owing to their lipophilic nature, EOs are advocated to penetrate viral membranes easily leading to membrane disruption. Moreover, EOs contain multiple active phytochemicals that can act synergistically on multiple stages of viral replication and also induce positive effects on host respiratory system including bronchodilation and mucus lysis. At present, only computer-aided docking and few in vitro studies are available which show anti-SARC-CoV-2 activities of EOs. In this review, role of EOs in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is discussed. A discussion on possible side effects associated with EOs as well as anti-corona virus claims made by EOs manufacturers are also highlighted. Based on the current knowledge a chemo-herbal (EOs) combination of the drugs could be a more feasible and effective approach to combat this viral pandemic.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Docking studies; Essential oils; Immunomodulatory; SARC-CoV-2","alpha farnesene; anethole; anticoronavirus agent; beta farnesene; carvacrol; cinnamaldehyde; cinnamyl acetate; essential oil; eucalyptus oil; eugenol; farnesol; garlic oil; geraniol; menthol; pulegone; terpinen 4 ol; thymol; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; essential oil; immunologic factor; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; antiinflammatory activity; antiviral activity; coronavirus disease 2019; human; immunomodulation; infection prevention; nonhuman; pandemic; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus replication; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; medicinal plant; virus pneumonia; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antiviral Agents; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Oils, Volatile; Pandemics; Plants, Medicinal; Pneumonia, Viral"

Hospital Kuala Lumpur, where thoracic procedures are performed, was badly affected. We describe our experience in performing aerosol generating procedures safely in thoracic surgery during the Covid-19 era. Methods: Medical records of patients who underwent thoracic surgery from March 18, 2020 to May 17, 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. All patients undergoing thoracic surgery were tested for Covid-19 using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method. Patients with malignancy were observed for 10 to 14 days in the ward after testing negative. The healthcare workers donned personal protective equipment for all the cases, and the number of healthcare workers in the operating room was limited to the minimum required. Results: A total of 44 procedures were performed in 26 thoracic surgeries. All of these procedures were classified as aerosol generating, and the mean duration of the surgery was 130 ± 43 minutes. None of the healthcare workers involved in the surgery were exposed or infected by Covid-19. Conclusion: Covid-19 will be a threat for a long time and thoracic surgeons must continue to provide their services, despite having to deal with aerosol generating procedures, in the new normal. Covid-19 testing of all surgical candidates, using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, donning full personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, and carefully planned procedures are among the measures suggested to prevent unnecessary Covid-19 exposure in thoracic surgery. © The Author(s) 2020.","COVID-19; delivery of health care; Malaysia; thoracic surgical procedures","adult; aerosol; Article; bronchoscopy; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; coronavirus disease 2019; decortication; female; health care personnel; human; intensive care unit; Malaysia; male; operation duration; protective glasses; respiratory tract infection; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; thorax surgery; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; laboratory technique; Malaysia; middle aged; operating room; pandemic; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aerosols; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Diagnostic Imaging; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Operating Rooms; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Thoracic Surgical Procedures"

Further there is no drug that is specific to treat COVID-19. A number of antiviral drugs such as Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Azithromycin and Doxycycline have been recommended or are being used to treat COVID-19 patients. In addition to these drugs, rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine to treat COVID-19, arguably with certain precautions and criticism. In line with the proposed use of chloroquine, Nigella sativa (black seed) could be considered as a natural substitute that contains a number of bioactive components such as thymoquinone, dithymoquinone, thymohydroquinone, and nigellimine. Further benefits to use N. sativa could be augmented by Zn supplement. Notably, Zn has been proven to improve innate and adaptive immunity in the course of any infection, be it by pathogenic virus or bacteria. The effectiveness of the Zn salt supplement could also be enhanced with N. sativa as its major bioactive component might work as ionophore to allow Zn2+ to enter pneumocytes – the target cell for SARSCoV-2. Given those benefits, this review paper describes how N. sativa in combination with Zn could be useful as a complement to COVID-19 treatment. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Chloroquine; Pneumocytes; RNA dependent RNA polymerase; SARS-CoV-2; Thymoquinone; Zinc transporter","chloroquine; dithymoquinone; hydroxychloroquine; Nigella sativa extract; nigellimine; plant medicinal product; thymohydroquinone; thymoquinone; unclassified drug; zinc; adaptive immunity; black cumin; coronavirus disease 2019; human; immune response; innate immunity; mineral supplementation; nonhuman; nutritional requirement; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus replication"

Five reliable databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus were used to obtain relevant studies of the given topic. Several filtering and scanning stages were performed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria to screen the 36 studies obtained; however, only 11 studies met the criteria. Taxonomy was performed, and the 11 studies were classified on the basis of two categories, namely, review and research studies. Then, a deep analysis and critical review were performed to highlight the challenges and critical gaps outlined in the academic literature of the given subject. Results showed that no relevant study evaluated and benchmarked AI techniques utilised in classification tasks (i.e. binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical classifications) of COVID-19 medical images. In case evaluation and benchmarking will be conducted, three future challenges will be encountered, namely, multiple evaluation criteria within each classification task, trade-off amongst criteria and importance of these criteria. According to the discussed future challenges, the process of evaluation and benchmarking AI techniques used in the classification of COVID-19 medical images considered multi-complex attribute problems. Thus, adopting multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an essential and effective approach to tackle the problem complexity. Moreover, this study proposes a detailed methodology for the evaluation and benchmarking of AI techniques used in all classification tasks of COVID-19 medical images as future directions; such methodology is presented on the basis of three sequential phases. Firstly, the identification procedure for the construction of four decision matrices, namely, binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical, is presented on the basis of the intersection of evaluation criteria of each classification task and AI classification techniques. Secondly, the development of the MCDA approach for benchmarking AI classification techniques is provided on the basis of the integrated analytic hierarchy process and VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje methods.

Computational simulations have played an important role to predict the development of the current pandemic. Such simulations enable early indications on the future projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control action in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a well-known method used in computational simulations of infectious viral diseases and it has been widely used to model other epidemics such as Ebola, SARS, MERS, and influenza A. This paper presents a modified SEIRS model with additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and resusceptibility, where we can tune the exit conditions in the model to extend prediction on the current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes; death, recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. The model also considers specific information such as ageing factor of the population, time delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, as well as resusceptibility with temporal immune response. Owing to huge variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model aims to reflect better on the current scenario and case data reported, such that the spread of the disease and the efficiency of the control action taken can be better understood. The model is verified using two case studies based on the real-world data in South Korea and Northern Ireland. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Mathematical modelling and simulation; Resusceptibility; SEIRS; Time delay","Disease control; Diseases; Efficiency; Time delay; Timing circuits; Viruses; Ageing population; Clinical symptoms; Computational simulation; Control actions; Future projections; Mathematical modeling and simulation; Northern Ireland; Specific information; Delay control systems"

Today, nurses and physicians are faced with unprecedented work pressures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in several psychological disorders such as stress, anxiety and sleep disturbances. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbances in hospital nurses and physicians facing the COVID-19 patients. Method: A systematic review and metanalysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA criteria. The PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, Web of science, CINHAL, Medline, and Google Scholar databases were searched with no lower time-limt and until 24 June 2020. The heterogeneity of the studies was measured using I2 test and the publication bias was assessed by the Egger's test at the significance level of 0.05. Results: The I2 test was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the selected studies, based on the results of I2 test, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians is I2: 97.4% and I2: 97.3% respectively. After following the systematic review processes, 7 cross-sectional studies were selected for meta-analysis. Six studies with the sample size of 3745 nurses were examined in and the prevalence of sleep disturbances was approximated to be 34.8% (95% CI: 24.8-46.4%). The prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians was also measured in 5 studies with the sample size of 2123 physicians. According to the results, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians caring for the COVID-19 patients was reported to be 41.6% (95% CI: 27.7-57%). Conclusion: Healthcare workers, as the front line of the fight against COVID-19, are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of this disease than other groups in society. Increasing workplace stress increases sleep disturbances in the medical staff, especially nurses and physicians. In other words, increased stress due to the exposure to COVID-19 increases the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians. Therefore, it is important for health policymakers to provide solutions and interventions to reduce the workplace stress and pressures on medical staff. © 2020 The Author(s).","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Nurses; Physicians; Sleep disturbances","COVID-19; database; epidemic; health status; health worker; mental health; meta-analysis; occupational exposure; pathogen; qualitative analysis; sleep; viral disease; vulnerability; workplace; age distribution; Athens Sleep disturbances Scale; coronavirus disease 2019; human; job stress; meta analysis; nurse; physician; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; prevalence; priority journal; regression analysis; Review; risk factor; sample size; sleep disorder; sleep disorder assessment; Sleep disturbances Severity Index; systematic review; workplace; Coronavirus infection; cross-sectional study; nurse; nursing; pandemic; physician; psychology; sleep disorder; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus; Scopus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Nurses; Pandemics; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Sleep Wake Disorders"

As many countries around the world, Malaysia and other southeast Asian (SEA) countries have also enforced lockdown at different degrees to contain the spread of the disease, which has brought some positive effects on natural environment. Therefore, evaluating the reduction in anthropogenic emissions due to COVID-19 and the related governmental measures to restrict its expansion is crucial to assess its impacts on air pollution and economic growth. In this study, we used aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from Himawari-8 satellite, along with tropospheric NO2 column density from Aura-OMI over SEA, and ground-based pollution measurements at several stations across Malaysia, in order to quantify the changes in aerosol and air pollutants associated with the general shutdown of anthropogenic and industrial activities due to COVID-19. The lockdown has led to a notable decrease in AOD over SEA and in the pollution outflow over the oceanic regions, while a significant decrease (27% - 30%) in tropospheric NO2 was observed over areas not affected by seasonal biomass burning. Especially in Malaysia, PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations have been decreased by 26–31%, 23–32%, 63–64%, 9–20%, and 25–31%, respectively, in the urban areas during the lockdown phase, compared to the same periods in 2018 and 2019. Notable reductions are also seen at industrial, suburban and rural sites across the country. Quantifying the reductions in major and health harmful air pollutants is crucial for health-related research and for air-quality and climate-change studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosols; COVID-19; Himawari-8; NO2; Pollutants; Southeast Asia","Aerosols; Air quality; Climate change; Economics; Troposphere; Aerosol optical depths; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric environment; CO concentrations; Economic growths; Industrial activities; Natural environments; Pollution measurement; Nitrogen oxides; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; aerosol; Aura (satellite); concentration (composition); COVID-19; environmental impact assessment; ground-based measurement; human activity; optical depth; pollution monitoring; respiratory disease; satellite data; troposphere; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; biomass; combustion; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental impact; industrial area; Malaysia; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; priority journal; quarantine; rural area; seasonal variation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Southeast Asia; suburban area; troposphere; urban area; air pollution; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; human; pandemic; sea; virus pneumonia; Southeast Asia; Coronavirus; Air Pollution; Asia, Southeastern; Betacoronavirus; Carbon Monoxide; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Malaysia; Nitrogen Dioxide; Oceans and Seas; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Sulfur Dioxide"

Cross-sectional survey. Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical practices of spine surgeons within the Asia Pacific region. Summary of Background Data. COVID-19 pandemic had changed spine surgeons’ clinical practices and their concerns toward personal and family risk of infection. Methods. This cross-sectional survey was carried out from May 4, 2020 to June 4, 2020. The questionnaire was administered using REDCAP. The online questionnaire includes four sections. First section includes surgeon’s demographics, background, type of clinical practice, and status of pandemic in their country. Second section includes volume and the type of spine surgery practice before the COVID pandemic. Third section includes changes of clinical practice during the pandemic and the last section was regarding their concern on COVID transmission. Results. Total of 222 respondents from 19 countries completed the questionnaire. During the pandemic, 92.3% of the respondents felt their clinical practice was affected. 58.5% respondents reported reduced outpatient clinic hours and 74.6% respondents reported reduced operation theatre hours due to the enforcement by the hospital administration. The mean reduction of clinic volume for all countries was 48.1%. There was a significant reduction in the number of surgeries performed in Japan, Malaysia, India, Philippines, and South Korea. This was due to reduced patient load. More than 60% of respondents were worried being infected by COVID-19 virus and >68% were worried of transmission to their family members. Conclusion. COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the clinical and surgical practice of spine surgeons in the Asia Pacific region. Clinics were closed or the practice hours reduced. Similarly, surgical theaters were closed, reduced, or limited to semi-emergency and emergency surgeries. Spine surgeons were moderately concerned of contracting COVID-19 during their clinical practice but were extremely concerned to transmit this disease to their family members. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

There are major concerns in Africa due to existing high prevalence rates for both infectious and non-infectious diseases and limited resources in terms of personnel, beds and equipment. Alongside this, concerns that lockdown and other measures will have on prevention and management of other infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are an increasing issue with rising morbidity and mortality rates. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that a lack of nets and treatment could result in up to 18 million additional cases of malaria and up to 30,000 additional deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Objective: Document current prevalence and mortality rates from COVID-19 alongside economic and other measures to reduce its spread and impact across Africa. In addition, suggested ways forward among all key stakeholder groups. Our Approach: Contextualise the findings from a wide range of publications including internet-based publications coupled with input from senior-level personnel. Ongoing Activities: Prevalence and mortality rates are currently lower in Africa than among several Western countries and the USA. This could be due to a number of factors including early instigation of lockdown and border closures, the younger age of the population, lack of robust reporting systems and as yet unidentified genetic and other factors. Innovation is accelerating to address concerns with available equipment. There are ongoing steps to address the level of misinformation and its consequences including fines. There are also ongoing initiatives across Africa to start addressing the unintended consequences of COVID-19 activities including lockdown measures and their impact on NCDs including the likely rise in mental health disorders, exacerbated by increasing stigma associated with COVID-19. Strategies include extending prescription lengths, telemedicine and encouraging vaccination. However, these need to be accelerated to prevent increased morbidity and mortality. Conclusion: There are multiple activities across Africa to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and address misinformation, which can have catastrophic consequences, assisted by the WHO and others, which appear to be working in a number of countries. Research is ongoing to clarify the unintended consequences given ongoing concerns to guide future activities. Countries are learning from each other. © Copyright © 2020 Ogunleye, Basu, Mueller, Sneddon, Seaton, Yinka-Ogunleye, Wamboga, Miljković, Mwita, Rwegerera, Massele, Patrick, Niba, Nsaikila, Rashed, Hussein, Hegazy, Amu, Boahen-Boaten, Matsebula, Gwebu, Chirigo, Mkhabela, Dlamini, Sithole, Malaza, Dlamini, Afriyie, Asare, Amponsah, Sefah, Oluka, Guantai, Opanga, Sarele, Mafisa, Chikowe, Khuluza, Kibuule, Kalemeera, Mubita, Fadare, Sibomana, Ramokgopa, Whyte, Maimela, Hugo, Meyer, Schellack, Rampamba, Visser, Alfadl, Malik, Malande, Kalungia, Mwila, Zaranyika, Chaibva, Olaru, Masuka, Wale, Hwenda, Kamoga, Hill, Barbui, Bochenek, Kurdi, Campbell, Martin, Phuong, Thanh and Godman.","Africa; COVID-19; health policy; misinformation; prevalence; review; treatment; unintended consequences","anakinra; anticoagulant agent; antimalarial agent; antivirus agent; azithromycin; BCG vaccine; chloroquine; clozapine; dexamethasone; emapalumab; herbaceous agent; hydroxychloroquine; immunomodulating agent; interferon beta serine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; placebo; psychotropic agent; remdesivir; ribavirin; sarilumab; steroid; tocilizumab; umifenovir; Africa; antibiotic resistance; artificial ventilation; case management; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; crowding (area); disease surveillance; drug overdose; drug safety; hand washing; health care financing; health workforce; heart disease; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypercoagulability; infection rate; intensive care; leadership; mass screening; mental disease; misinformation; mixed infection; mortality rate; nonhuman; pandemic; patient education; polypharmacy; prevalence; public health message; quarantine; resource allocation; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; self medication; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distancing; social media; socioeconomics; stigma; telemedicine; travel; virus shedding; virus transmission"

The impact of the pandemic is likely to be more pronounced on cancer survivors living in resource-limited settings, such as in Southeast Asia. As health care systems in the region try to streamline resources and accommodate the influx of patients from COVID-19, many in the cancer community have experienced severe disruptions in their care. The delays and disruption of timely access to cancer care could lead to patients presenting with worsened conditions and at more advanced cancer stages in which treatment options tended to be costlier. Similar to countries around the world, the various forms of movement restrictions that were enforced have aggravated the rates of unemployment, loss of wages and the limited access to support from family or friends around Southeast Asia. The economic impact of COVID-19 hits even harder on the large proportion of the population in the region that works in the informal sector, who are often one paycheque or one episode of illness away from financial catastrophe. More worryingly, the lack of a robust social security system in many Southeast Asian countries, especially in terms of income protection, could ultimately force many cancer survivors to choose between paying for their treatments, or to forego treatments, and feed their families. Early identification of cancer patients experiencing financial toxicity following the pandemic will enable timely and appropriate interventions to be undertaken by various stakeholders, potentially averting a cascade of other economic fallouts that may last for years after cancer treatment. © 2020 the authors.","Cancer; COVID-19; Financial toxicity; Southeast Asia","cancer staging; cancer survivor; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; economic aspect; economic recession; family life; financial management; health care access; health care delivery; health care system; household; human; income; isolation; malignant neoplasm; medical decision making; pandemic; patient transport; prospective payment; resource management; Review; social security; social support; therapy delay; unemployment"

Hence, the education sector in developing countries like Bangladesh needs a quick transformation from traditional to technology-based distance learning. The factors influencing online education adoption are explained in this research with a Structural Equation Model (SEM). A survey of 405 students from the universities across Bangladesh revealed that faculty readiness, student readiness, and economic solvency positively impact the students' intention to adopt a technology-based design of higher education. Simultaneously, the online assessment system is a challenge for the students having a negative effect on their intention to adopt technology-based learning. Again, students' intention to adopt technology is substantial in explaining the adoption of online classes by them. The study suggests combining the classroom model with the e-learning model to create a cohesive learning system in the long run. Thus, the model proposed in this research has a crucial implication, which recommends the policymakers to consider it to design a new form of technology-based education in Bangladesh. © 2020, Interaction Design and Architecture(s) Journal - IxD&A.

"Knowledge and Confidence Level Among Emergency Healthcare Workers in Airway Management and Resuscitation of Suspected COVID-19 Patients: A Cross Sectional Study in Malaysia",2020,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096818071&doi=10.47102%2fannals-acadmedsg.2020335&partnerID=40&md5=7a30943fdc5c6afaee0d4ea8434b3ce2","INTRODUCTION: This study aims to evaluate the knowledge and confidence of emergency healthcare workers (EHCW) in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional online study using a validated questionnaire was distributed to doctors (MD), assistant medical officers (AMO), and staff nurses (SN) at an urban tertiary Emergency Department. It comprised of 40 knowledge and 10 confidence-level questions related to resuscitation and airway management steps. RESULTS: A total of 135 from 167 eligible EHCW were enrolled. 68.9% (n = 93) had high knowledge while 53.3% (n = 72) possessed high confidence level. Overall knowledge mean score was 32.96/40 (SD = 3.63) between MD (33.88±3.09), AMO (32.28±4.03), and SN (32.00±3.60), P= 0.025. EHCWs with a length of service (LOS) between 4-10 years had the highest knowledge compared to those with LOS <4-year (33.71±3.39 versus 31.21±3.19 P = 0.002). Airway-related knowledge was significantly different between the designations and LOS (P = 0.002 and P = 0.003, respectively). Overall, EHCW confidence level against LOS showed significant difference [F (2, 132) = 5.46, P = 0.005] with longer LOS showing better confidence. MD showed the highest confidence compared to AMO and SN (3.67±0.69, 3.53±0.68, 3.26±0.64) P = 0.049. The majority EHCW were confident in performing high-quality chest-compression, and handling of Personal Protective Equipment but less than half were confident in resuscitating, leading the resuscitation, managing the airway or being successful in first intubation attempt. CONCLUSIONS: EHCW possessed good knowledge in airway and resuscitation of COVID-19 patients, but differed between designations and LOS. A longer LOS was associated with better confidence, but there were some aspects in airway management and resuscitation that needed improvement.",,"adult; clinical competence; cross-sectional study; disease transmission; female; health care personnel; hospital emergency service; human; infection control; Malaysia; male; middle aged; nurse; physician; prevention and control; procedures; protective equipment; respiration control; resuscitation; self concept; therapy; young adult; Adult; Airway Management; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Clinical Competence; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Nurses; Personal Protective Equipment; Physicians; Self Concept; Young Adult"

Currently, it has affected more than 2,850,000 people. No vaccine or drug is available yet, and therefore researchers and scientists are striving to identify potential drugs or vaccines for combating this virus. We were unable to find any review of the literature or analysis on ongoing registered clinical trials that reported diagnostic tests, therapeutics, vaccines and devices for COVID-19 along with estimated enrollment, participants’ ages, study type, start and completion date, status, treatment/intervention and country. OBJECTIVE: To review ongoing trials relating to COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search for clinical trials was conducted in the ClinicalTrials.gov database up to April 12, 2020. A total of 339 trials relating to COVID-19 were analyzed and key information on each trial was recorded. RESULTS: Most of the trials were being conducted in the United States and completion of most of them was expected by May 2020. They were mostly on drugs and treatment, while a minority were on diagnostic tests. The analysis showed that hydroxychloroquine was investigated in most of the trials. The trials identified were categorized into five classes: a) diagnostic tests; b) therapeutics; c) biologics and vaccines; d) devices and products; and e) others. CONCLUSION: The trials identified have potential against COVID-19 that can be applied in treatment processes after the necessary investigations and experiments. Additionally, the items identified were organized in a proper way, which can assist in current research activities. © 2020 by Associação Paulista de Medicina.","Records; SARS virus; Therapeutics; Vaccines","acetylcysteine; ascorbic acid; azithromycin; beta1a interferon; biological marker; ceftaroline; ceftriaxone; corticosteroid; darunavir; dexamethasone; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; emtricitabine; escin; hydroxychloroquine; ibuprofen; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin M antibody; immunosuppressive agent; interferon beta serine; interleukin 15; lopinavir plus ritonavir; losartan; macrolide; mavrilimumab; methylprednisolone; moxifloxacin; naproxen; nitric oxide; nivolumab; oseltamivir; piclidenoson; ritonavir; rivaroxaban; siltuximab; tacrolimus; tenofovir; tenofovir disoproxil; thalidomide; uric acid; valsartan; algorithm; allergic rhinitis; artificial intelligence; clinical trial (topic); computer assisted tomography; continuous hemofiltration; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; echocardiography; echography; edema; electrocardiogram; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gas chromatography; health care personnel; honey; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; immunosuppressive treatment; intensive care unit; lung lavage; macular degeneration; multiple sclerosis; myocarditis; nose smear; physical activity; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; quality of life; respiratory failure; Review; risk factor; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; vaccination; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; United States; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; United States"

As a result, it has become important to understand the disease trends in order to mitigate its effects. The aim of this study is firstly to develop a prediction model for daily confirmed COVID-19 cases based on several covariates, and secondly, to select the best prediction model based on a subset of these covariates. Methodology: This study was conducted using daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 collected from the official Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH) and John Hopkins University websites. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the training data of observed cases from 22 January to 31 March 2020, and subsequently validated using data on cases from 1 April to 17 April 2020. The ARIMA model satisfactorily forecasted the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from 18 April 2020 to 1 May 2020 (the testing phase). Results: The ARIMA (0,1,0) model produced the best fit to the observed data with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value of 16.01 and a Bayes Information Criteria (BIC) value of 4.170. The forecasted values showed a downward trend of COVID-19 cases until 1 May 2020. Observed cases during the forecast period were accurately predicted and were placed within the prediction intervals generated by the fitted model. Conclusions: This study finds that ARIMA models with optimally selected covariates are useful tools for monitoring and predicting trends of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia.

On the other hand, Deep learning is one of the most important fields of medical imaging science at present. In this article, a model of deep learning is being trained for the COVID19 detection in CT Scan images. This study is implemented using Python programming language. To build and train the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model, Python Deep Learning libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 have been utilized. As for the dataset, the open source dataset of COVID-19 chest computed tomography (CT) images were used. These image where been confirmed by the senior radiologist who performed Diagnosis of and treatment of patients with COVID-19. There were total of 745 images belonging to two classes were sampled. 348 positive (+) COVID-19 images and 397 negative (-) COVID-19 images. Based on the training process, the model was able to detect 79 per cent accuracy on the test set. The performance of the model, Convolution Neural Network were evaluated by comparing with Logistic Regression model. Findings from the research proves that Convolution Neural Network are reliable by producing higher accuracy rate of 79% while Logistic Regression produce a rate of 54%.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction swab test as a diagnostic tool to confirm COVID-19 cases. This test requires at least a day for the results to come out depending on the available facilities. Many countries have adopted a targeted approach in screening potential patients due to the cost. However, there is a need for a fast and accurate screening test to complement this targeted approach, so that the potential virus carriers can be quarantined as early as possible. The X-ray is a good screening modality; it is quick at capturing, cheap, and widely available, even in third world countries. Therefore, a deep learning approach has been proposed to automate the screening process by introducing LightCovidNet, a lightweight deep learning model that is suitable for the mobile platform. It is important to have a lightweight model so that it can be used all over the world even on a standard mobile phone. The model has been trained with additional synthetic data that were generated from the conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network. LightCovidNet consists of three components, which are entry, middle, and exit flows. The middle flow comprises five units of feed-forward convolutional neural networks that are built using separable convolution operators. The exit flow is designed to improve the multi-scale capability of the network through a simplified spatial pyramid pooling module. It is a symmetrical architecture with three parallel pooling branches that enable the network to learn multi-scale features, which is suitable for cases wherein the X-ray images were captured from all over the world independently. Besides, the usage of separable convolution has managed to reduce the memory usage without affecting the classification accuracy. The proposed method managed to get the best mean accuracy of 0.9697 with a low memory requirement of just 841,771 parameters. Moreover, the symmetrical spatial pyramid pooling module is the most crucial component; the absence of this module will reduce the screening accuracy to just 0.9237. Hence, the developed model is suitable to be implemented for mass COVID-19 screening. © 2020 by the authors.","COVID-19 screening; Feed-forward layer; Lightweight deep learning model; Separable convolution; Spatial pyramid pooling module",

Novel drug development does not always account for orphan diseases, which have low demand and hence low-profit margins for drug developers. Recently, drug repositioning has gained recognition as an alternative approach that explores new avenues for pre-existing commercially approved or rejected drugs to treat diseases aside from the intended ones. Drug repositioning results in lower overall developmental expenses and risk assessments, as the efficacy and safety of the original drug have already been well accessed and approved by regulatory authorities. The greatest advantage of drug repositioning is that it breathes new life into the novel, rare, orphan, and resistant diseases, such as Cushing's syndrome, HIV infection, and pandemic outbreaks such as COVID-19. Repositioning existing drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Ivermectin and Baricitinib shows good potential for COVID-19 treatment. This can crucially aid in resolving outbreaks in urgent times of need. This review discusses the past success in drug repositioning, the current technological advancement in the field, drug repositioning for personalised medicine and the ongoing research on newly emerging drugs under consideration for the COVID-19 treatment. © 2020 by the authors.

Subsequent reductions in various anthropogenic activities have led to improved air quality during the lockdown. In this study, we apply a widely used exposure-response function to estimate the short-term health impacts associated with PM2.5 changes over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region due to COVID-19 lockdown. Concentrations of PM2.5 during lockdown period reduced by 22.9% to 54.0% compared to pre-lockdown level. Estimated PM2.5-related daily premature mortality during lockdown period is 895 (95% confidential interval: 637–1,081), which is 43.3% lower than pre-lockdown period and 46.5% lower compared with averages of 2017–2019. According to our calculation, total number of avoided premature death aassociated with PM2.5 reduction during the lockdown is estimated to be 42.4 thousand over the YRD region, with Shanghai, Wenzhou, Suzhou (Jiangsu province), Nanjing, and Nantong being the top five cities with largest health benefits. Avoided premature mortality is mostly contributed by reduced death associated with stroke (16.9 thousand, accounting for 40.0%), ischemic heart disease (14.0 thousand, 33.2%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7.6 thousand, 18.0%). Our calculations do not support or advocate any idea that pandemics produce a positive note to community health. We simply present health benefits from air pollution improvement due to large emission reductions from lowered human and industrial activities. Our results show that continuous efforts to improve air quality are essential to protect public health, especially over city-clusters with dense population. © 2020.

Vaccines and targeted therapeutics to prevent infections and stop virus proliferation are currently lacking. Endoribonuclease Nsp15 plays a vital role in the life cycle, including replication and transcription as well as virulence of the virus. Here, we investigated Vitamin D for its in silico potential inhibition of the binding sites of SARS-CoV-2 endoribonuclease Nsp15. In this study, we selected Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Vitamin D to study the potential binding affinity with the putative binding sites of endoribonuclease Nsp15 of COVID-19. The docking study was applied to rationalize the possible interactions of the target compounds with the active site of endoribonuclease Nsp 15. Among the results, Vitamin D was found to have the highest potency with strongest interaction in terms of LBE, lowest RMSD, and lowest inhibition intensity Ki than the other standard compounds. The investigation results of endoribonuclease Nsp15 on the PrankWeb server showed that there are three prospective binding sites with the ligands.

"Mobile health apps on COVID-19 launched in the early days of the pandemic: Content analysis and review",2020,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091191705&doi=10.2196%2f19796&partnerID=40&md5=b9ef19833db7db65dd7f7755dc02fb4c","Background: Mobile health (mHealth) app use is a major concern because of the possible dissemination of misinformation that could harm the users. Particularly, it can be difficult for health care professionals to recommend a suitable app for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) education and self-monitoring purposes. Objective: This study aims to analyze and evaluate the contents as well as features of COVID-19 mobile apps. The findings are instrumental in helping health care professionals to identify suitable mobile apps for COVID-19 self-monitoring and education. The results of the mobile apps' assessment could potentially help mobile app developers improve or modify their existing mobile app designs to achieve optimal outcomes. Methods: The search for the mHealth apps available in the android-based Play Store and the iOS-based App Store was conducted between April 18 and May 5, 2020. The region of the App Store where we performed the search was the United States, and a virtual private network app was used to locate and access COVID-19 mobile apps from all countries on the Google Play Store. The inclusion criteria were apps that are related to COVID-19 with no restriction in language type. The basic features assessment criteria used for comparison were the requirement for free subscription, internet connection, education or advisory content, size of the app, ability to export data, and automated data entry. The functionality of the apps was assessed according to knowledge (information on COVID-19), tracing or mapping of COVID-19 cases, home monitoring surveillance, online consultation with a health authority, and official apps run by health authorities. Results: Of the 223 COVID-19-related mobile apps, only 30 (19.9%) found in the App Store and 28 (44.4%) in the Play Store matched the inclusion criteria. In the basic features assessment, most App Store (10/30, 33.3%) and Play Store (10/28, 35.7%) apps scored 4 out of 7 points. Meanwhile, the outcome of the functionality assessment for most App Store apps (13/30, 43.3%) was a score of 3 compared to android-based apps (10/28, 35.7%), which scored 2 (out of the maximum 5 points). Evaluation of the basic functions showed that 75.0% (n=36) of the 48 included mobile apps do not require a subscription, 56.3% (n=27) provide symptom advice, and 41.7% (n=20) have educational content. In terms of the specific functions, more than half of the included mobile apps are official mobile apps maintained by a health authority for COVID-19 information provision. Around 37.5% (n=18) and 31.3% (n=15) of the mobile apps have tracing or mapping and home monitoring surveillance functions, respectively, with only 17% (n=8) of the mobile apps equipped with an online consultation function. Conclusions: Most iOS-based apps incorporate infographic mapping of COVID-19 cases, while most android-based apps incorporate home monitoring surveillance features instead of providing focused educational content on COVID-19. It is important to evaluate the contents and features of COVID-19 mobile apps to guide users in choosing a suitable mobile app based on their requirements. © Long Chiau Ming, Noorazrina Untong, Nur Amalina Aliudin, Norliza Osili, Nurolaini Kifli, Ching Siang Tan, Khang Wen Goh, Pit Wei Ng, Yaser Mohammed Al-Worafi, Kah Seng Lee, Hui Poh Goh.

"Estimating the Impact of Daily Weather on the Temporal Pattern of COVID-19 Outbreak in India",2020,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091170377&doi=10.1007%2fs41748-020-00179-1&partnerID=40&md5=1176d5e614232fd590288b6fc16548dc","The COVID-19 pandemic has spread obstreperously in India. The increase in daily confirmed cases accelerated significantly from ~ 5 additional new cases (ANC)/day during early March up to ~ 249 ANC/day during early June. An abrupt change in this temporal pattern was noticed during mid-April, from which can be inferred a much reduced impact of the nationwide lockdown in India. Daily maximum (TMax), minimum (TMin), mean (TMean) and dew point temperature (TDew), wind speed (WS), relative humidity, and diurnal range in temperature and relative humidity during March 01 to June 04, 2020 over 9 major affected cities are analyzed to look into the impact of daily weather on COVID-19 infections on that day and 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 days before those cases were detected (i.e., on the likely transmission days). Spearman’s correlation exhibits significantly lower association with WS, TMax, TMin, TMean, TDew, but is comparatively better with a lag of 14 days. Support Vector regression successfully estimated the count of confirmed cases (R2 ' 0.8) at a lag of 12–16 days, thus reflecting a probable incubation period of 14 ± 02 days in India. Approximately 75% of total cases were registered when TMax, TMean, TMin, TDew, and WS at 12–16 days previously were varying within the range of 33.6–41.3 °C, 29.8–36.5 °C, 24.8–30.4 °C, 18.7–23.6 °C, and 4.2–5.75 m/s, respectively. Thus, we conclude that coronavirus transmission is not well correlated (linearly) with any individual weather parameter; rather, transmission is susceptible to a certain weather pattern. Hence multivariate non-linear approach must be employed instead. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; India; Temporal trend; Weather","climate effect; correlation; COVID-19; dew point; disease spread; disease transmission; respiratory disease; viral disease; India; Coronavirus"
"A putative prophylactic solution for COVID‐19: Development of novel multiepitope vaccine candidate against sars‐cov‐2 by comprehensive immunoinformatic and molecular modelling approach",2020,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091112654&doi=10.3390%2fbiology9090296&partnerID=40&md5=02a44a5f6d9c935f3fe9830739ab5005","The outbreak of 2019‐novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) that causes severe respiratory infection (COVID‐19) has spread in China, and the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. However, no approved drug or vaccines are available, and treatment is mainly supportive and through a few repurposed drugs. The urgency of the situation requires the development of SARS‐CoV‐2‐based vaccines. Immunoinformatic and molecular modelling are time‐efficient methods that are generally used to accelerate the discovery and design of the candidate peptides for vaccine development. In recent years, the use of multiepitope vaccines has proved to be a promising immunization strategy against viruses and pathogens, thus inducing more comprehensive protective immunity. The current study demonstrated a comprehensive in silico strategy to design stable multiepitope vaccine construct (MVC) from B‐cell and T‐cell epitopes of essential SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins with the help of adjuvants and linkers. The integrated molecular dynamics simulations analysis revealed the stability of MVC and its interaction with human Toll‐like receptors (TLRs), which trigger an innate and adaptive immune response. Later, the in silico cloning in a known pET28a vector system also estimated the possibility of MVC expression in Escherichia coli. Despite that this study lacks validation of this vaccine construct in terms of its efficacy, the current integrated strategy encompasses the initial multiple epitope vaccine design concepts. After validation, this MVC can be present as a better prophylactic solution against COVID‐19. © 2020 by the authors.

Past studies indicate that prosperity can be attained through the sustainability in security and development, in the sense which resources are effectively and efficiently managed for the state and its society. The creation of the state's prosperity includes the development of human capital through the platform of education. However, the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic outbreak had disrupted higher education sector. In Malaysia, the Movement Control Order (MCO) or 'Malaysia lockdown' was declared by the authority starting from March 18, 2020, to curb the spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 outbreak and MCO restriction disrupted the higher education stakeholders to ‘normally’ continue with their academic activities. The disruption of the academic activities has affected the students’ well-being and welfare, especially those from the bottom billion families. The main aim of the study is to obtain a preliminary understanding of the students’ experiences on their well-being and welfare during the MCO in times of COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The study was conducted during the first phase of the MCO period from 18 to 31 Marchusing multiple Phone Calls interviews. Thirty-three (33) respondents from Bottom40 families participated in the study. The study managed to gather twenty (20) variables clustered in the ‘Prosperity Quadrant for Sustainability in Security and Development during the MCO in Times of COVID-19 Pandemic' based on experiences highlighted by the respondents from B40 families.

It is known that HCWs who serve as front-liners during the COVID-19 pandemic experience stress and have the fear of contracting the infection. Little is known of how being a positive contact affects HCWs. Objective: We examined the experience of HCWs who were quarantined following a close unprotected contact with a COVID-19 positive colleague and explore the psychological impact especially as the timing of the quarantine coincided with the Eid (annual Muslim festival) celebration in Malaysia. Methods: This was a cross-sectional on-line questionnaire study, involving HCWs exposed to a COVID-19 positive colleague in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, a teaching hospital. Data on demographics, levels of depression, anxiety and stress using a validated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire, aspects of quarantine, wearing of masks, hand hygiene practice and swab experience were collected. Results: Twenty-two HCWs participated. Eighteen (81.8%) were between 30-39 years and 17 (77.3%) were women. Majority 19 (86.3%) were Malays. There were twelve (54.5%) medical officers, 5 (22.7%) specialists and 5(22.7%) allied health staff. Eighteen out of 22 (81.8%) felt they were able to do home quarantine adequately. All tested negative with a mean (Standard Deviation) hour of contact of 2.56±2.38 hours. Eighteen reported their biggest concern was infecting their families. Conclusion: HCWs undergoing contact swabbing and quarantine are vulnerable to depression, anxiety and stress. The ability of the HCW to adequately home quarantine should not be taken for granted. Psychological support should be offered to HCWs who are positive contacts. © 2020, Malaysian Medical Association.

The objective of this review was to identify the incidence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19, determine the onset of their symptoms and the risk factors of anosmia, hyposmia, ageusia or dysgeusia for COVID-19 infection. Methods: We searched the PubMed and Google Scholar on 15th May 2020, with search terms including SARS-COV-2, coronavirus, COVID-19, hyposmia, anosmia, ageusia and dysgeusia. The articles included were cross sectional studies, observational studies and retrospective or prospective audits, letters to editor and short communications that included a study of a cohort of patients. Case reports, case-series and interventional studies were excluded. Discussion: A total of 16 studies were selected. Incidence of smell and taste dysfunction was higher in Europe (34 to 86%), North America (19 to 71%) and the Middle East (36 to 98%) when compared to the Asian cohorts (11 to 15%) in COVID-19 positive patients. Incidence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19 negative patients was low in comparison (12 to 27%). Total incidence of smell and taste dysfunction from COVID-19 positive and negative patients from seven studies was 20% and 10% respectively. Symptoms may appear just before, concomitantly, or immediately after the onset of the usual symptoms. Occurs predominantly in females. When occurring immediately after the onset of the usual symptoms, the median time of onset was 3.3 to 4.4 days. Symptoms persist for a period of seven to 14 days. Patients with smell and taste dysfunction were reported to have a six to ten-fold odds of having COVID-19. Conclusion: Smell and taste dysfunction has a high incidence in Europe, North America, and the Middle East. The incidence was lower in the Asia region. It is a strong risk factor for COVID-19. It may be the only symptom and should be added to the list of symptoms when screening for COVID-19. © 2020, Malaysian Medical Association.

Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS), a public university in Borneo, was accelerated into alert phase because of high risk of case importation from more than 400 China incoming undergraduates. Measures to mitigate the potential COVID-19 outbreaks in its population were taken by using conventional public health measures with special attention to task-shifting and widespread community mental health interventions. A Preparedness and Response Centre was established to overseer the mitigating measures happening inside the university. Measures taken included empowerment of frontline staff, strengthening of restrictions, strengthening university health center, vigorous contact tracing, widespread health education, maintaining cultural sensitivity, and establishment of early standard operating procedures and university continuity plans.

The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that affected more than 215 countries with over 23 million cases and 800,000 deaths as of today. The situation is critical, especially with the absence of specific medicines or vaccines; hence, efforts toward the development of anti-COVID-19 medicines are being intensively undertaken. One of the potential therapeutic targets of anti-COVID-19 drugs is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 was identified as a key functional receptor for CoV associated with COVID-19. ACE2, which is located on the surface of the host cells, binds effectively to the spike protein of CoV, thus enabling the virus to infect the epithelial cells of the host. Previous studies showed that certain flavonoids exhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition activity, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of arterial blood pressure. Thus, it is being postulated that these flavonoids might also interact with ACE2. This postulation might be of interest because these compounds also show antiviral activity in vitro. This article summarizes the natural flavonoids with potential efficacy against COVID-19 through ACE2 receptor inhibition. © 2020 by the authors","ACE2; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Flavonoid","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; biological product; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; flavonoid; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; disease predisposition; drug effect; health survey; human; life cycle stage; meta analysis; metabolism; molecular model; pandemic; physiology; structure activity relation; virology; virus pneumonia; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Biological Products; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Susceptibility; Flavonoids; Humans; Life Cycle Stages; Models, Molecular; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Population Surveillance; Structure-Activity Relationship"

While these measures are imperative to mitigate spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on psychosocial health is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from more than one thousand responders on social participation and life satisfaction. Methods: Thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia, and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in 7 languages (English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Slovenian). Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions. Results: 1047 participations (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%), and others (3%) were included in the analysis. Findings revealed psychosocial strain during the enforced COVID-19 home confinement. Large decreases (p < 0.001) in the amount of social activity through family (−58%), friends/neighbors (−44.9%), or entertainment (−46.7%) were triggered by the enforced confinement. These negative effects on social participation were also associated with lower life satisfaction (−30.5%) during the confinement period. Conversely, the social contact score through digital technologies significantly increased (p < 0.001) during the confinement period with more individuals (+24.8%) being socially connected through digital technology. Conclusion: These preliminary findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the early COVID-19 home confinement period in 2020. Therefore, in order to mitigate the negative psychosocial effects of home confinement, implementation of national strategies focused on promoting social inclusion through a technology-based solution is strongly suggested. © 2020 by the authors.

To prepare for public availability, the acceptability of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to pay (WTP) were assessed to provide insights into future demand forecasts and pricing considerations. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 3 to 12 April 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used to assess predictors of the intent to receive the vaccine and the WTP. Results: A total of 1,159 complete responses was received. The majority reported a definite intent to receive the vaccine (48.2%), followed by a probable intent (29.8%) and a possible intent (16.3%). Both items under the perceived benefits construct in the HBM, namely believe the vaccination decreases the chance of infection (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.19–5.26) and the vaccination makes them feel less worry (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.03–4.65), were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the vaccine. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) for the amount that participants were willing to pay for a dose of COVID-19 vaccine was MYR$134.0 (SD±79.2) [US$30.66 ± 18.12]. Most of the participants were willing to pay an amount of MYR$100 [US$23] (28.9%) and MYR$50 [US$11.5] (27.2%) for the vaccine. The higher marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by no affordability barriers as well as by socio-economic factors, such as higher education levels, professional and managerial occupations and higher incomes. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate the utility of HBM constructs in understanding COVID-19 vaccination intention and WTP. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","COVID-19 vaccination; health belief model; intention; Malaysia; willingness to pay","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; adult; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; disease severity; female; five point scale; health belief; health status; household income; human; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; occupation; perception; scoring system; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; six point scale; social network; vaccination; Willingness To Pay; young adult; adolescent; aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; economics; epidemiology; health care cost; health care survey; immunology; Malaysia; pandemic; patient attitude; psychological model; psychology; socioeconomics; vaccination; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Care Surveys; Health Expenditures; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pneumonia, Viral; Socioeconomic Factors; Vaccination; Viral Vaccines; Young Adult"

Methods: This study is supported and endorsed by the Asia Pacific Society of Interventional Cardiology. Due to the inability to have face to face discussions during the pandemic, an online survey was performed by inviting key opinion leaders (cardiac surgeon/interventional cardiologist/echocardiologist) in the field of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in Asia to participate. The answers to a series of questions pertaining to the impact of COVID-19 on TAVI were collected and analyzed. These led subsequently to an expert consensus recommendation on the conduct of TAVI during the pandemic. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a 25% (10-80) reduction of case volume and 53% of operators required triaging to manage their patients with severe aortic stenosis. The two most important parameters used to triage were symptoms and valve area. Periprocedural changes included the introduction of teleconsultation, preprocedure COVID-19 testing, optimization of protests, and catheterization laboratory set up. In addition, length of stay was reduced from a mean of 4.4 to 4 days. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the delivery of TAVI services to patients in Asia.

Management of idiopathic Central Nervous system inflammatory disorders (iCNSID) such as Multiple sclerosis, Neuromyelitis optica and its spectrum disorders and related conditions during this pandemic needs to be addressed with affirmative and sustainable strategies in order to prevent disease related risks, medication related complications and possible COVID-19 disease associated effects. Global international iCNSIDs agencies and recent publications are attempting to address this but such guidance is not available in South East Asia. Here we outline prospectively qualitatively and quantitatively novel strategies at a tertiary center in Malaysia catering for neuroimmunological disorders despite modest resources during this pandemic. In this retrospective study with longitudinal follow-up, we describe stratification of patients for face to face versus virtual visits in the absence of formal teleneurology, stratification of patients for treatment according to disease activity, rescheduling, deferring initiation or extending treatment intervals of certain disease modifying therapies(DMT's) or immunosuppressants(IS), especially those producing lymphocyte depletion in MS and the continuation of IS in patients with NMO/NMOSD. Furthermore, we highlight the use off-label treatments such as Intravenous immunoglobulins/rituximab,bridging interferons/Teriflunomide temporarily replacing more potent DMT choices,supply challenges of IS/DMT's and tailoring blood watches and neuroimaging surveillance based on the current health needs to stave off the pandemic and prevent at risk patients with iCNSID/health care workers from possibly being exposed to the COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Covid-19; Idiopathic central nervous system inflammatory diseases; Multiple sclerosis; Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders; Resource limited settings","azathioprine; beta1a interferon; cladribine; cyclophosphamide; eculizumab; fingolimod; immunoglobulin; interferon beta serine; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; mycophenolate mofetil; rituximab; teriflunomide; tocilizumab; Article; central nervous system disease; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; disease activity; follow up; health care management; health care need; human; longitudinal study; lymphocyte depletion; major clinical study; multiple sclerosis; myelooptic neuropathy; neuroimaging; neurology; pandemic; prospective study; retrospective study; risk factor; Southeast Asia; telemedicine; teleneurology; complication; multiple sclerosis; myelooptic neuropathy; patient care; Asia, Southeastern; Continuity of Patient Care; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Multiple Sclerosis; Neuromyelitis Optica; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies"

It is recommended that the public should cultivate the basic skills to evaluate information and determine its validity. On the other hand, the authorities should refrain from placing the blame on patients to avoid them from being stigmatized.

Its profile in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) is largely unknown. We studied the liver injury patterns of SARS-Cov-2 in CLD patients, with or without cirrhosis. Methods: Data was collected from 13 Asian countries on patients with CLD, known or newly diagnosed, with confirmed COVID-19. Results: Altogether, 228 patients [185 CLD without cirrhosis and 43 with cirrhosis] were enrolled, with comorbidities in nearly 80%. Metabolism associated fatty liver disease (113, 61%) and viral etiology (26, 60%) were common. In CLD without cirrhosis, diabetes [57.7% vs 39.7%, OR = 2.1 (1.1–3.7), p = 0.01] and in cirrhotics, obesity, [64.3% vs. 17.2%, OR = 8.1 (1.9–38.8), p = 0.002] predisposed more to liver injury than those without these. Forty three percent of CLD without cirrhosis presented as acute liver injury and 20% cirrhotics presented with either acute-on-chronic liver failure [5 (11.6%)] or acute decompensation [4 (9%)]. Liver related complications increased (p < 0.05) with stage of liver disease; a Child-Turcotte Pugh score of 9 or more at presentation predicted high mortality [AUROC 0.94, HR = 19.2 (95 CI 2.3–163.3), p < 0.001, sensitivity 85.7% and specificity 94.4%). In decompensated cirrhotics, the liver injury was progressive in 57% patients, with 43% mortality. Rising bilirubin and AST/ALT ratio predicted mortality among cirrhosis patients. Conclusions: SARS-Cov-2 infection causes significant liver injury in CLD patients, decompensating one fifth of cirrhosis, and worsening the clinical status of the already decompensated. The CLD patients with diabetes and obesity are more vulnerable and should be closely monitored. © 2020, Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver.","Acute liver injury; Chronic liver disease; COVID-19; SARS CoV2","alanine aminotransferase; albumin; antivirus agent; aspartate aminotransferase; azathioprine; azithromycin; bilirubin; favipravir; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin G; lopinavir; oseltamivir; remdesivir; ritonavir; steroid; terlipressin; unclassified drug; acute kidney failure; acute on chronic liver failure; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; Asian; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bilirubin blood level; Child Pugh score; chronic liver disease; clinical outcome; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; decompensated liver cirrhosis; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease course; disease predisposition; disease severity; fatty liver; female; human; liver cirrhosis; liver injury; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; obesity; plasma exchange; plasmapheresis; priority journal; renal replacement therapy; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus hepatitis; acute on chronic liver failure; Asia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; isolation and purification; liver cirrhosis; liver function test; middle aged; pandemic; pathophysiology; patient acuity; procedures; prognosis; risk assessment; risk factor; virology; virus pneumonia; Acute-On-Chronic Liver Failure; Asia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Function Tests; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Acuity; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors"

The world is now immobilized by this infectious RNA virus. As of June 15, already more than 7.9 million people have been infected and 432k people died. This RNA virus has the ability to do the mutation in the human body. Accurate determination of mutation rates is essential to comprehend the evolution of this virus and to determine the risk of emergent infectious disease. This study explores the mutation rate of the whole genomic sequence gathered from the patient's dataset of different countries. The collected dataset is processed to determine the nucleotide mutation and codon mutation separately. Furthermore, based on the size of the dataset, the determined mutation rate is categorized for four different regions: China, Australia, the United States, and the rest of the World. It has been found that a huge amount of Thymine (T) and Adenine (A) are mutated to other nucleotides for all regions, but codons are not frequently mutating like nucleotides. A recurrent neural network-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model has been applied to predict the future mutation rate of this virus. The LSTM model gives Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.06 in testing and 0.04 in training, which is an optimized value. Using this train and testing process, the nucleotide mutation rate of 400th patient in future time has been predicted. About 0.1% increment in mutation rate is found for mutating of nucleotides from T to C and G, C to G and G to T. While a decrement of 0.1% is seen for mutating of T to A, and A to C. It is found that this model can be used to predict day basis mutation rates if more patient data is available in updated time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Gene sequence; LSTM model; Mutation rate; Neural Network; SARS-Cov-2","Computer viruses; Diseases; Forecasting; Hospital data processing; Mean square error; Nucleotides; RNA; Time series analysis; Viruses; Coronaviruses; Genomic sequence; Infectious disease; Mutation rates; Nucleotide mutation; Root mean square errors; Testing process; Time series prediction; Long short-term memory"

Moreover, due to the current pandemic, some countries have prioritized health resources towards COVID-19 management, making it more challenging to appropriately care for other potentially disabling and fatal diseases such as stroke. The aim of this study is to identify and describe changes in stroke epidemiological trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This is an international, multicenter, hospital-based study on stroke incidence and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will describe patterns in stroke management, stroke hospitalization rate, and stroke severity, subtype (ischemic/hemorrhagic), and outcomes (including in-hospital mortality) in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with the corresponding data from 2018 and 2019, and subsequently 2021. We will also use an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to assess the change in stroke hospitalization rates before, during, and after COVID-19, in each participating center. Conclusion: The proposed study will potentially enable us to better understand the changes in stroke care protocols, differential hospitalization rate, and severity of stroke, as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, this will help guide clinical-based policies surrounding COVID-19 and other similar global pandemics to ensure that management of cerebrovascular comorbidity is appropriately prioritized during the global crisis. It will also guide public health guidelines for at-risk populations to reduce risks of complications from such comorbidities. © 2020","COVID-19; Health policy; Incidence; Mortality; National crisis; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Stroke","Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebral sinus thrombosis; cerebrovascular disease; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease burden; disease severity; health care planning; hospital mortality; hospitalization; human; incidence; neurosurgery; outcome assessment; priority journal; prospective study; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; subarachnoid hemorrhage; thrombectomy; time series analysis; Betacoronavirus; cerebrovascular accident; clinical practice; clinical trial; comorbidity; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; health care disparity; host pathogen interaction; mortality; multicenter study; pandemic; pathogenicity; register; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Healthcare Disparities; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Incidence; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prospective Studies; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stroke; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"

Since the virus was first identified in December 2019, the number of deaths have been propagating exponentially, causing countries across the world, including Malaysia, to increase emergency measures to combat the virus. Due to the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic does not discriminate its victims, it is of paramount importance to construct a plan for management of the dead for all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including the unidentified deceased, as an essential portion of the humanitarian forensic action approach. This document provides an overview on ways to maximize the local collective capacity from various government agencies to manage the dead based on the prevailing regulations and legislation in the country, in preparation for possible large scale deaths from this pandemic. The National Institute of Forensic Medicine Malaysia has improvised procedures and guidelines for management of the dead within the existing regulations in order to achieve a balance between medicolegal requirements and the safety of personnel managing the bodies of the deceased with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection; at the site of death, during transport, during postmortem procedures, storage and preparation before and during burial or cremation as well as environmental cleaning and disinfection, involving various agencies in the country. A form of temporary controlled burial is as an option to allow the reinvestigation of a decedent to help formally identify victims of the pandemic such as undocumented migrants or refugees who were previously not identified. Due to the different legal requirements and mortality rates between countries, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the management of the dead. Whenever possible, every opportunity and assistance must be given to families to mourn their loved ones, even in times of crisis or an outbreak, in order to sustain an appropriate level of dignity and respect. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Humanitarian forensic action; Management of the dead; Pandemic","adult; aged; attitude to death; autopsy; Betacoronavirus; burial; cause of death; Coronavirus infection; cremation; female; forensic science; hospital mortality; human; Malaysia; male; middle aged; mortality; organization and management; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; posthumous care; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Death; Autopsy; Betacoronavirus; Burial; Cause of Death; Coronavirus Infections; Cremation; Female; Forensic Sciences; Funeral Rites; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Mortuary Practice; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral"

The management of the dead from COVID-19 should not impede the medicolegal investigation of the death where required by the authorities and legislation but additional health and safety precautions should be adopted for the necessary postmortem procedures. The authors have therefore used the craniotomy box in an innovative way to enable a safe alternative for skull and brain removal procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 bodies. The craniotomy box technique was tested on a confirmed COVID-19 positive body where a full postmortem examination was performed by a team of highly trained personnel in a negative pressure Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) autopsy suite in the National Institute of Forensic Medicine (IPFN) Malaysia. This craniotomy box is a custom-made transparent plastic box with five walls but without a floor. Two circular holes were made in one wall for the placement of arms in order to perform the skull opening procedure. A swab to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was taken from the interior surface of the craniotomy box after the procedure. The result from the test using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) proved that an additional barrier provided respiratory protection by containing the aerosols generated from the skull opening procedure. This innovation ensures procedures performed inside this craniotomy box are safe for postmortem personnel performing high risk autopsies during pandemics. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Aerosol-generating procedure; Autopsy; COVID-19; Craniotomy box; Safe alternative","adverse event; aerosol; autopsy; Betacoronavirus; brain; Coronavirus infection; craniotomy; devices; equipment design; gas mask; human; infection control; isolation and purification; medical device contamination; occupational exposure; occupational health; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathologist; pathology; prevention and control; protective clothing; protective equipment; risk assessment; risk factor; virology; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Autopsy; Betacoronavirus; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Craniotomy; Equipment Contamination; Equipment Design; Host Microbial Interactions; Humans; Infection Control; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Health; Pandemics; Pathologists; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Protective Clothing; Respiratory Protective Devices; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors"

To examine the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, we investigate the spread of this pandemic using Malaysia as a case study and scrutinise its interactions with some exogenous factors such as limited medical resources and false detection problems. To do this, we employ a simple epidemiological model and analyse this system using modelling and dynamical systems techniques. We discover some contrasting findings with respect to the observations of basic reproduction number: while it is observed that R0 seems to provide a good description of transmission dynamics in simple outbreak scenarios, this quantity might mislead the assessment on the severity of pandemic when certain complexities such as limited medical resources and false detection problems are incorporated into the model. In particular, we observe the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak through bistable behaviour, even when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. Based on these findings, we caution policy makers not to make their decisions solely based on the guidance of the basic reproduction number only, which clearly could cause trouble. © 2020","Alternative stable states; Bifurcation; False detection; Limited medical resources; SIRS epidemic model","Cell proliferation; Diseases; Dynamical systems; Dynamics; Transmissions; Basic reproduction number; Bistables; Epidemiological modeling; Exogenous factors; False detection problems; Policy makers; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Transmission dynamics; Medical problems"

The global pandemic lockdown has isolated many patients with chronic illnesses from their routine medical care. This narrative review article analyses the multitude of issues faced by individuals with underlying medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Sources for this publication were identified through searches of PubMed for articles published between 31st December 2019 and 4th June 2020, using combinations of search terms. Guidelines and updates from reputable agencies were also consulted. Only articles published in the English language were included. Results: The volume of literature on COVID-19 continues to expand, with 17,845 articles indexed on PubMed by 4th June 2020, 130 of which were deemed particularly relevant to the subject matter of this review. Older patients are more likely to progress to severe COVID-19 disease requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, especially hypertension and coronary heart disease, are at greatly increased risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19 disease. A controversial aspect of the management of COVID-19 disease has been the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Obese COVID-19 patients are more likely to require complex ICU management. Putative mechanisms of increased COVID-19 disease severity in diabetes include hyperglycaemia, altered immune function, sub-optimal glycaemic control during hospitalisation, a pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory state. Patients with mental health disorders are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, and this has been compounded by the suspension of non-emergency care in hospitals around the world, making it difficult for patients with chronic mental illness to attend outpatient appointments. Conclusions: The global pandemic of COVID-19 disease has had a disproportionately negative impact on patients living with chronic medical illness. Future research should be directed at efforts to protect vulnerable patients from possible further waves of COVID-19 and minimising the negative impact of pandemic mitigation strategies on these individuals. © 2020 The Author(s).","Chronic illness; Co-morbidities; COVID-19; Novel coronavirus; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Travel","angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; adult; cardiovascular disease; chronic disease; chronic kidney failure; chronic respiratory tract disease; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; disease exacerbation; disease predisposition; disease severity; fatality; gastrointestinal disease; glycemic control; hemodialysis; hospitalization; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; immunocompromised patient; immunopathology; intensive care unit; ischemic heart disease; male type alopecia; malignant neoplasm; mental disease; mental health; metabolic disorder; obesity; outpatient; pandemic; practice guideline; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; Review; rheumatic disease; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social isolation; travel"

To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, China has imposed national lockdown policies to practise social distancing. This has led to reduced human activities and hence primary air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement of air quality as a side-product. To investigate the air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the YRD Region, we apply the WRF-CAMx modelling system together with monitoring data to investigate the impact of human activity pattern changes on air quality. Results show that human activities were lowered significantly during the period: industrial operations, VKT, constructions in operation, etc. were significantly reduced, leading to lowered SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and VOCs emissions by approximately 16–26%, 29–47%, 27–46% and 37–57% during the Level I and Level II response periods respectively. These emission reduction has played a significant role in the improvement of air quality. Concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 decreased by 31.8%, 45.1% and 20.4% during the Level I period; and 33.2%, 27.2% and 7.6% during the Level II period compared with 2019. However, ozone did not show any reduction and increased greatly. Our results also show that even during the lockdown, with primary emissions reduction of 15%–61%, the daily average PM2.5 concentrations range between 15 and 79 μg m−3, which shows that background and residual pollutions are still high. Source apportionment results indicate that the residual pollution of PM2.5 comes from industry (32.2–61.1%), mobile (3.9–8.1%), dust (2.6–7.7%), residential sources (2.1–28.5%) in YRD and 14.0–28.6% contribution from long-range transport coming from northern China. This indicates that in spite of the extreme reductions in primary emissions, it cannot fully tackle the current air pollution. Re-organisation of the energy and industrial strategy together with trans-regional joint-control for a full long-term air pollution plan need to be further taken into account. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; COVID-19; Yangtze River Delta","Air quality; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Viruses; Emission reduction; Human activity patterns; Industrial operations; Industrial strategies; Long range transport; PM2.5 concentration; Source apportionment; Yangtze river delta; River pollution; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; human activity; modeling; pollution monitoring; viral disease; weather forecasting; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; cluster analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; dust; human; human impact (environment); particulate matter; pollution transport; priority journal; quarantine; air pollutant; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; human activities; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Yangtze Delta; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Human Activities; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral"

Long battery life, long distance communication and low cost application specific devices are main focus of the engineers, LoRa is quite suitable for these requirements. IoT system includes four explicit sections for example sensors/devices, connectivity, processing of information and a user interface. The scope of communication has become the basic part on the majority of the IoT system, particularly in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth based IoT system. With the rise of LoRa technology, further enhancements to uses of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be figured it out. By utilizing a single receiver in the LoRa network, it can deal with numerous hubs at various areas inside the region, dissimilar to Wi-Fi-based framework which needs to have many access point to cover large area. Both LoRa and WiFi innovation has reduced total cost of IoT framework. For the wide range coverage of IoT system, LoRa is quite useful as compared to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for short range. However, there are a few inconveniences on the speed of transmission and constraint on the size of the payload.

However, the type of infection is different from influenza, avian flu, MERS-CoV or SARS. This new epidemic is known as the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later officially known as COVID-19. As a result of the spread of the disease, on March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention declared COVID-19 a pandemic. From the Linguistics perspective, this pandemic has rapidly germinated the corpus of the Malay vocabularies with the jargon and terms that relate to this virus crisis. For example, there are terms penjarakan sosial (social distancing), droplet, PPE, PKP and meratakan puncak lengkungan (flatten of the curve)’. There are even different terms that refer to a similar concept, such as nyahkuman and nyahvirus (for English term disinfection), and kadar peningkatan kes and lonjakan kes (for English term exponential spike). This may, of course, cause confusion for the user. Terminologically, the diversification of terms being coinaged needs to be taken into account to ensure that the terms are understood and used as these terms relate to the well-being of the community. In this regard, the study aims to analyse and describe the coinage of the terms related to COVID-19 that was initiated by the community. Working from the socio-terminological framework, this study will use the Ministry of Health Malaysia press release texts issued from 16th January 2020 to 10th May 2020 as the data of the analysis. Then, the terms studied are compared to the terms in the DBP database, and the findings are analysed by using a socio-terminological approach. The results of the study recorded that 67.0% (96) terms used by the Ministry of Health Malaysia were already standardised by DBP. However, some terms are indeed new terms, their formation is compliant with the term formation guidelines, though not favourable among terminologists. Thus, the popular terms in usage among the community should be respected to ensure that the Malay language is constantly evolving. © 2020, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

With numerous countries announcing various modes of self-quarantine and social distancing, the Malaysian government has initially called for a 3-week Movement Control Order (MCO) beginning mid-March 2020. In this paper, we explore how citizens in Malaysia respond to such crises by examining letters that were submitted during the MCO period to The Star Online – the nation’s leading English online news portal. Using corpus linguistics techniques, 227 letters were firstly investigated for recurrent words/phrases used on how people talk about issues during this time. A critical discourse analysis on these recurring patterns of language was then employed to further examine their occurrences in this corpus, following Carvalho’s (2008) analysis of media discourse. This, we contend as being the synergy between corpus methods and classic CDA that contribute to the corpus-assisted discourse analysis (CADS) approach. Results yield Malaysians’ view on the matter that could describe in so far as how the country is coping with the pandemic at the time. More specifically, letters that have mostly referred to COVID-19 pandemic as being a challenge and associating it with negative expressions are in fact emotionally charged, revealing how public letters written by citizen journalists provide a much more comprehensive view of public stance on COVID-19 in Malaysia. © 2020, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

The framing can shape our understanding of the virus. The Prime Ministers gave public broadcasts on or to the media in March, April and May 2020. The analysis of the broadcasts is comprised of metaphor identification using the Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP), and metaphor interpretation. COVID-19 in the Prime Ministers’ broadcasts is conceptualized by a few metaphors. The Prime Ministers utilize similar metaphors about the virus because metaphors of direction, journey, liquid and war are noted. COVID-19 IS WAR is selected because war metaphors have been recognized for other diseases and they have been commonly deployed during this pandemic. War metaphors frame several aspects of the virus, which cover its description, impact on multiple areas, the actors involved and their reactions.

As positive cases continued to rise in Malaysia, public health laboratories experienced an overwhelming demand for COVID-19 screening. The confirmation of positive cases of COVID-19 has solely been based on the detection of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In efforts to increase the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of COVID-19 screening, we evaluated the feasibility of pooling clinical Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab specimens during nucleic acid extraction without a reduction in sensitivity of qRT-PCR. Pools of 10 specimens were extracted and subsequently tested by qRT-PCR according to the WHO-Charité protocol. We demonstrated that the sample pooling method showed no loss of sensitivity. The effectiveness of the pooled testing strategy was evaluated on both retrospective and prospective samples, and the results showed a similar detection sensitivity compared to testing individual sample alone. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a pooled testing strategy to increase testing capacity and conserve resources, especially when there is a high demand for disease testing. © 2020 Lim et al.

Caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, this acute respiratory illness affects the human lungs and can easily spread from person to person. Since the disease heavily affects human lungs, analyzing the X-ray images of the lungs may prove to be a powerful tool for disease investigation. In this research, we use the information contained within the complex structures of X-ray images between the cases of COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases, whereas the case of healthy lungs is taken as the reference point. To analyze X-ray images, we benefit from the concept of Shannon's entropy and fractal theory. Shannon's entropy is directly related to the amount of information contained within the X-ray images in question, whereas fractal theory is used to analyze the complexity of these images. The results, obtained in this study, show that the method of fractal analysis can detect the level of infection among different respiratory diseases and that COVID-19 has the worst effect on the human lungs. In other words, the complexity of X-ray images is proportional to the severity of the respiratory disease. The method of analysis, employed in this study, can be used even further to analyze how COVID-19 progresses in affected patients. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Complexity; Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19); Fractal Analysis; Human Lungs; Respiratory Diseases; X-ray Image","Entropy; Fractals; Pulmonary diseases; Respiratory system; Acute respiratory illness; Amount of information; Complex structure; Complexity based; Fractal analysis; Method of analysis; Reference points; Shannon's entropy; Image analysis"

After content analysing 63 newspaper articles published online from March to May 2020, it is uncovered that the Malaysian tourism and hospitality industry has been affected terribly by the enforcement of MCO in order to curb the spread of COVID-19 health pandemic. Stories associated with income and job losses, cancellation of Visit Malaysia 2020 campaign, closure of tourist attractions and closing down of countless of hotels were apparent in the reporting of online news. Yet, the analysis of this paper adds to the existing knowledge by revealing that despite encountering difficulty during this time of crisis, the Malaysian hospitality industry was able to show their appreciation towards medical frontliners who risk their lives to save COVID-19 patients. Some hotels demonstrate their corporate social responsibility (CSR) by offering free accommodation and other services to health personnel. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Content analysis; Covid-19 pandemic; Health tourism; Hospitality industry",

The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites that can evade detection by RDTs threatens control and elimination efforts. These parasites lack or have altered genes encoding histidine-rich proteins (HRPs) 2 and 3, the antigens recognized by HRP2- based RDTs. Surveillance of such parasites is dependent on identifying false-negative RDT results among suspected malaria cases, a task made more challenging during the current pandemic because of the overlap of symptoms between malaria and COVID-19, particularly in areas of low malaria transmission.

This study aims to examine individuals’ perception of health conditions and test availability as potential predictors of mental health—insomnia, anxiety, depression, and distress—during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey of 669 adults in Malaysia was conducted during 2–8 May 2020, six weeks after the Movement Control Order (MCO) was issued. We found adults’ perception of health conditions had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with insomnia, anxiety, depression, and distress. Perceived test availability for COVID-19 also had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with anxiety and depression. Younger adults reported worse mental health, but people from various religions and ethnic groups did not differ significantly in reported mental health. The results indicated that adults with worse health conditions had more mental health problems, and the worse degree deepened for unhealthy people. Perceived test availability negatively predicted anxiety and depression, especially for adults perceiving COVID-19 test unavailability. The significant predictions of perceived health condition and perceived COVID-19 test availability suggest a new direction for the literature to identify the psychiatric risk factors directly from health-related variables during a pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

We aim to present the first study in Malaysia to report the reproduction numbers and develop a mathematical model forecasting COVID-19 transmission by including isolation, quarantine, and movement control measures. We utilized a susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) model by incorporating isolation, quarantine, and movement control order (MCO) taken in Malaysia. The simulations were fitted into the Malaysian COVID-19 active case numbers, allowing approximation of parameters consisting of probability of transmission per contact (β), average number of contacts per day per case (ζ), and proportion of close-contact traced per day (q). The effective reproduction number (Rt) was also determined through this model. Our model calibration estimated that (β), (ζ), and (q) were 0.052, 25 persons, and 0.23, respectively. The (Rt) was estimated to be 1.68. MCO measures reduce the peak number of active COVID-19 cases by 99.1% and reduce (ζ) from 25 (pre-MCO) to 7 (during MCO). The flattening of the epidemic curve was also observed with the implementation of these control measures. We conclude that isolation, quarantine, and MCO measures are essential to break the transmission of COVID-19 in Malaysia. © 2020 by the authors.

The main objective was to examine the impact of the pandemic and the subsequent MCO on the various business aspects of the SMEs as well as to make recommendations to the government on supportive measures for the SMEs. The survey found that although all aspects of the business were impacted, the two major concerns of the SMEs during this crisis were the financial management and the supply chain disruptions. Inevitably, it was found that most of the SMEs were operating well below capacity, which was a huge financial strain on their business viability. It was recommended that the government provide measures to help the SMEs manage their cash-flow and ease the restrictions to facilitate supply-chain commencement that is crucial to their business. The survey also revealed that most SMEs acknowledged the importance of automation and the adoption of technologies.

In this commentary, we identify challenges and opportunities at human–primate interfaces in light of COVID-19, focusing on examples from Asia, and make recommendations for researchers working with wild primates to reduce zoonosis risk and leverage research opportunities. First, we briefly review the evidence for zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss risks of zoonosis at the human–primate interface. We then identify challenges that the pandemic has caused for primates, including reduced nutrition, increased intraspecific competition, and increased poaching risk, as well as challenges facing primatologists, including lost research opportunities. Subsequently, we highlight opportunities arising from pandemic-related lockdowns and public health messaging, including opportunities to reduce the intensity of problematic human–primate interfaces, opportunities to reduce the risk of zoonosis between humans and primates, opportunities to reduce legal and illegal trade in primates, new opportunities for research on human–primate interfaces, and opportunities for community education. Finally, we recommend specific actions that primatologists should take to reduce contact and aggression between humans and primates, to reduce demand for primates as pets, to reduce risks of zoonosis in the context of field research, and to improve understanding of human–primate interfaces. Reducing the risk of zoonosis and promoting the well-being of humans and primates at our interfaces will require substantial changes from “business as usual.” We encourage primatologists to help lead the way. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","biosafety; ethics; human–primate conflict; provisioning; SARS-CoV-2; zoonosis","Primates; SARS coronavirus; animal; Coronavirus infection; environmental protection; feeding behavior; human; pandemic; physiology; primate; primate disease; risk factor; virology; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Coronavirus Infections; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Primate Diseases; Primates; Risk Factors; Zoonoses"

As such, robust monitoring of the impact of the health crisis and containment measures across agricultural value chains will likely prove vitally important. With Bangladesh as a case study, we discuss the building blocks of a comprehensive monitoring system for prioritizing and designing interventions that respond to food system disruptions from COVID-19 and preemptively avoid further cascading negative effects. We also highlight the need for parallel research that identifies pathways for enhancing information flow, analysis, and action to improve the efficiency and reliability of input and output value chains. In aggregate, this preliminary work highlights the building blocks of resilient food systems to external shocks such as COVID-19 pandemic in the context of developing nations. In doing so, we call attention to the importance of ‘infection safe’ agricultural input and output distribution logistics, extended social safety nets, adequate credit facilities, and innovative labor management tools alongside, appropriate farm mechanization. In addition, digital extension services, circular nutrient flows, enhanced storage facilities, as well as innovative and robust marketing mechanisms are required.

The overwhelming increasing amount of infections has led to a major strain on major healthcare services. This leads to shortages in hospital beds, ventilators and critical personnel protective equipment. This article focuses on the critical adaptations from a general surgery department in Malaysia which is part of a Malaysian tertiary hospital that treats COVID-19 cases. The core highlights of these strategies enforced during this pandemic are: (1) surgery ward and clinic decongestions; (2) deferment of elective surgeries; (3) restructuring of medical personnel work force; (4) utilization of online applications for tele-communication; (5) operating room (OR) adjustments and patient screening; and (6) continuing medical education and updating practices in context to COVID-19. These adaptations were important for the continuation of emergency surgery services, preventing transmission of COVID-19 amongst healthcare workers and optimization of medical personnel work force in times of a global pandemic.

However, comprehensive global data analyses for its mortality risk factors are lacking. The current investigation aimed to assess the predictors of death among COVID-19 patients from worldwide open access data. Methods: A total of 828 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with definite outcomes were retrospectively identified from open access individual-level worldwide data. Univariate followed by multivariable regression analysis were used to evaluate the association between potential risk factors and mortality. Results: Majority of the patients were males 59.1% located in Asia 69.3%. Based on the data, older age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.079; 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 1.064–1.095 per year increase), males (aOR, 1.607; 95% CI, 1.002–2.576), patients with hypertension (aOR, 3.576; 95% CI, 1.694–7.548), diabetes mellitus (aOR, 12.234; 95% CI, 4.126–36.272), and patients located in America (aOR, 7.441; 95% CI, 3.546–15.617) were identified as the risk factors of mortality among COVID-19 patients.

"Multi-Biological Laboratory Examination Framework for the Prioritization of Patients with COVID-19 Based on Integrated AHP and Group VIKOR Methods",2020,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087507760&doi=10.1142%2fS0219622020500285&partnerID=40&md5=54c01f481b1373fca33c932ffa36d20b","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has a tremendous effect on people's lives worldwide, and the number of infected patients increases daily. The healthcare sector is affected by a large number of patients with COVID-19, and a solution is urgently needed to avert the risk of deteriorating patients in terms of prioritizing patients based on their health conditions. Prioritization of patients with COVID-19 is a complex and multi-criteria decision-analysis (MCDA) problem due to (i) multiple biological laboratory examination criteria, (ii) criteria importance and (iii) trade-off amongst the criteria. This study presents a new multi-biological laboratory examination framework for prioritizing patients with COVID-19 on the basis of integrated MCDA methods. The experiment was conducted on the basis of three phases. In the first phase, patient datasets containing eight biological laboratory examination criteria for six patients with COVID-19 were derived and discussed. The outcome of this phase was used to propose a decision matrix on the basis of the intersection between ""biological laboratory examination criteria""and ""COVID-19 patients list"". In the second phase, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was utilized to set the subjective weights for the biological laboratory examination criteria by respiratory experts. In the last phase, the VIekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method was adopted to prioritize patients in the context of individual and group decision making (GDM). Results showed that (1) the integration of AHP-VIKOR method based on individual and GDM contexts was effective for solving prioritization problems for patients with COVID-19, and (2) the prioritization results of patients with COVID-19 showed no variation in the internal and external VIKOR GDM contexts. The proposed multi-biological laboratory examination framework can differentiate between the mild and serious or critical condition of patients with COVID-19 by prioritizing them based on integrated AHP-VIKOR methods. In conclusion, medical sectors can use the proposed framework to differentiate the health conditions of infected patients and to assign appropriate care with prompt and effective treatment. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","analytic hierarchy process; COVID-19; inflammatory marker; multi-criteria decision making; prioritization; respiratory; VIKOR","Analytic hierarchy process; Behavioral research; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Health risks; Hierarchical systems; Laboratories; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Biological laboratory; Critical condition; Group Decision Making; Healthcare sectors; Infected patients; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Subjective weights; Patient treatment"

Outbreak situation: A stringent screening process at all airports in Malaysia was enforced after the first case outside China was reported in Thailand. Up to April 14, 2020, Malaysia had reported two waves of COVID-19 cases, with the first wave ending successfully within less than 2 months. In early March 2020, the second wave occurred, with worrying situations. Actions taken: The Government of Malaysia enforced a Movement Control Order starting on March 18, 2020 to break the chain of COVID-19. The media actively spread the hashtag #stayhome. Non-governmental organizations, as well as prison inmates, started to produce personal protective equipment for frontliners. Various organizations hosted fundraising events to provide essentials mainly to hospitals. A provisional hospital was set up and collaborations with healthcare service providers were granted, while additional laboratories were assigned to enhance the capabilities of the Ministry of Health. Economic downturn: An initial financial stimulus amounting to RM 20.0 billion was released in February 2020, before the highlighted PRIHATIN Package, amounting to RM 250 billion, was announced.

The impact of COVID-19 on urological services in different geographical areas is unknown. Objective: To investigate the global impact of COVID-19 on urological providers and the provision of urological patient care. Design, setting, and participants: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted from March 30, 2020 to April 7, 2020. A 55-item questionnaire was developed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of urological services. Target respondents were practising urologists, urology trainees, and urology nurses/advanced practice providers. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary outcome was the degree of reduction in urological services, which was further stratified by the geographical location, degree of outbreak, and nature and urgency of urological conditions. The secondary outcome was the duration of delay in urological services. Results and limitations: A total of 1004 participants responded to our survey, and they were mostly based in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. Worldwide, 41% of the respondents reported that their hospital staff members had been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, 27% reported personnel shortage, and 26% had to be deployed to take care of COVID-19 patients. Globally, only 33% of the respondents felt that they were given adequate personal protective equipment, and many providers expressed fear of going to work (47%). It was of concerning that 13% of the respondents were advised not to wear a surgical face mask for the fear of scaring their patients, and 21% of the respondents were advised not to discuss COVID-19 issues or concerns on media. COVID-19 had a global impact on the cut-down of urological services, including outpatient clinic appointments, outpatient investigations and procedures, and urological surgeries. The degree of cut-down of urological services increased with the degree of COVID-19 outbreak. On average, 28% of outpatient clinics, 30% of outpatient investigations and procedures, and 31% of urological surgeries had a delay of >8 wk. Urological services for benign conditions were more affected than those for malignant conditions. Finally, 47% of the respondents believed that the accumulated workload could be dealt with in a timely manner after the COVID-19 outbreak, but 50% thought the postponement of urological services would affect the treatment and survival outcomes of their patients. One of the limitations of this study is that Africa, Australia, and New Zealand were under-represented. Conclusions: COVID-19 had a profound global impact on urological care and urology providers. The degree of cut-down of urological services increased with the degree of COVID-19 outbreak and was greater for benign than for malignant conditions. One-fourth of urological providers were deployed to assist with COVID-19 care. Many providers reported insufficient personal protective equipment and support from hospital administration. Patient summary: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has led to significant delay in outpatient care and surgery in urology, particularly in regions with the most COVID-19 cases. A considerable proportion of urology health care professionals have been deployed to assist in COVID-19 care, despite the perception of insufficient training and protective equipment. The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed great challenges to the urological community globally. The impact of COVID-19 on urological services increased with the degree of outbreak, and resulted in significant delay in the delivery of urological care. © 2020","Coronavirus disease-19; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Survey; Urological service; Urology; UroSoMe","adult; advanced practice nurse; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; female; geography; global health; groups by age; health care personnel; health service; health survey; hospital personnel; hospital policy; human; male; medical student; outcome assessment; patient care; personnel shortage; priority journal; structured questionnaire; urinary tract disease; urological care; urologist; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial; complication; Coronavirus infection; global health; incidence; middle aged; multicenter study; pandemic; questionnaire; retrospective study; urinary tract disease; urologic surgery; urology; virus pneumonia; workload; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Global Health; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urologic Diseases; Urologic Surgical Procedures; Urologists; Urology; Workload"

Relatively little attention has been paid to understanding how the pandemic has affected treatment, prevention and control of malaria, which is a major cause of death and disease and predominantly affects people in less well-resourced settings. Main body: Recent successes in malaria control and elimination have reduced the global malaria burden, but these gains are fragile and progress has stalled in the past 5 years. Withdrawing successful interventions often results in rapid malaria resurgence, primarily threatening vulnerable young children and pregnant women. Malaria programmes are being affected in many ways by COVID-19. For prevention of malaria, insecticide-treated nets need regular renewal, but distribution campaigns have been delayed or cancelled. For detection and treatment of malaria, individuals may stop attending health facilities, out of fear of exposure to COVID-19, or because they cannot afford transport, and health care workers require additional resources to protect themselves from COVID-19. Supplies of diagnostics and drugs are being interrupted, which is compounded by production of substandard and falsified medicines and diagnostics. These disruptions are predicted to double the number of young African children dying of malaria in the coming year and may impact efforts to control the spread of drug resistance. Using examples from successful malaria control and elimination campaigns, we propose strategies to re-establish malaria control activities and maintain elimination efforts in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is likely to be a long-term challenge. All sectors of society, including governments, donors, private sector and civil society organisations, have crucial roles to play to prevent malaria resurgence. Sparse resources must be allocated efficiently to ensure integrated health care systems that can sustain control activities against COVID-19 as well as malaria and other priority infectious diseases. Conclusion: As we deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that other major killers such as malaria are not ignored. History tells us that if we do, the consequences will be dire, particularly in vulnerable populations. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-19; Drug resistance; Elimination; Malaria; Plasmodium","Asia; cause of death; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; disease burden; disease eradication; disease severity; drug resistance; exposure; fear; global health; health care facility; health care personnel; health care system; health impact assessment; human; long term care; malaria; malaria control; pathogen clearance; public health campaign; Review; risk factor; society; adult; Betacoronavirus; child; comorbidity; Coronavirus infection; female; health care planning; malaria; middle aged; organization and management; pandemic; pregnancy; preventive health service; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Child; Community Health Planning; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Resistance; Female; Humans; Malaria; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Preventive Health Services; Young Adult"

With the declaration of COVID-19 a global pandemic, and later the appearance of first confirmed cases in Yemen, there is an urgent need to assess the preparedness of healthcare facilities (HCFs) and their capacities to tackle a looming COVID-19 outbreak. Herein, we present an assessment of the current state of preparedness and capabilities of HCFs in Yemen to prevent and manage the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: An online survey for HCFs was developed, validated, and distributed. The questionnaire is divided into five main sections: (1) Demographic variables for participants. (2) HCFs capabilities for COVID-19 outbreak. (3) Support received to face the emergence and spread of COVID-19. (4). Current practices of infection prevention and control measures in the HCFs. The last section focused on the recommendations to ensure effective and timely response to this outbreak in Yemen. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze data using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS), version 23. Results: Responses were received from healthcare workers (HCWs) from 18 out of 22 governorates in Yemen. Out of the 296 HCWs who participated in the study, the vast majority (93.9%) believed that the healthcare system in Yemen does not have the resources and capabilities to face and manage a COVID-19 outbreak. Approximately 82.4% of participants rated the general preparedness level of their HCFs as very poor or poor. More specifically, the majority of HCWs rated their HCFs as very poor or poor in term of availability of the following: an adequate number of mechanical ventilators (88.8%), diagnostic devices (88.2%), ICU rooms and beds (81.4%), and isolation rooms (79.7%). Conclusions: The healthcare facilities in Yemen are unprepared and lack the most basic resources and capabilities to cope with or tackle a COVID-19 outbreak. With the current state of a fragile healthcare system, a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in Yemen could result in devastating consequences. There is an urgent need to provide support to the healthcare workers and HCFs that are on the frontline against COVID-19. © Copyright © 2020 Zawiah, Al-Ashwal, Saeed, Kubas, Saeed, Khan, Sulaiman and Abduljabbar.","capabilities; COVID-19; healthcare facilities; preparedness; Yemen",

The objective of this study was to investigate anxiety symptoms and use of preventive measures against COVID-19. The study also compared the association between preventive measures and anxiety symptoms during the week immediately preceding the study and those symptoms and measures at the beginning of the outbreak. Methods: A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire commenced on 14 February 2020. The study participants were residents of Taiwan ages 20 to 70 years. The 6-item state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. The questions about preventive measures asked participants about their personal protection, cough etiquette, contact precautions, voluntary quarantine, and prompt reporting. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the factors influencing an increase in the preventive measures scores. Results: Of a total of 3555 completed responses, a total of 52.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 50.4-53.7) of the respondents reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety symptoms in the past week, whereas 48.8% (95%CI 47.2-50.5) reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the outbreak. With a higher score indicating greater anxiety, the median scores for anxiety symptoms in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 46.7 (IQR [interquartile range] 36.7-53.3) and 43.3 (IQR 36.7-53.3), respectively. The median scores for the preventive measures taken in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 26.0 (IQR 21.0-30.0) and 24.0 (IQR 19.0-28.0), respectively, out of a maximum score of 36. In the multivariable analysis, an increased anxiety symptom score from the beginning of the outbreak to the past week (adjusted OR = 7.38, 95%CI 6.28-8.66) was a strongly significant determinant of an increased preventive measures score in the past week compared with the score at the beginning of the outbreak. Conclusions: Anxiety and preventive measures scores were high and increased with the epidemic rate. Higher anxiety was associated with an increased use of preventive measures against COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-19; Preventive measures; Public anxiety; STAI-6; Taiwan","adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; attitude to illness; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cross-sectional study; disease severity; epidemic; female; health behavior; health survey; human; infection prevention; major clinical study; male; population research; quarantine; questionnaire; scoring system; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; symptom; very elderly; voluntary reporting; anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; health behavior; middle aged; pandemic; protective equipment; psychology; quarantine; severity of illness index; statistical model; Taiwan; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult"

This study was conducted to assess the acceptance of a 50 or 95% effective COVID-19 vaccine, when it becomes available in southeast Asia, among the general population in Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 25 and April 6, 2020. Participants were asked if they would accept a free vaccine which was 95 or 50% effective. Using a logistic regression model, we assessed the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to COVID-19 information, or perceived risk of infection with acceptance of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Among 1,359 respondents, 93.3% of respondents (1,268/1,359) would like to be vaccinated for a 95% effective vaccine, but this acceptance decreased to 67.0% (911/1,359) for a vaccine with 50% effectiveness. For a 95% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker and having a higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection were associated with higher acceptance, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.01; 95%CI: 1.01, 4.00 and aOR: 2.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 4.59, respectively; compared to civil servants, being retired was associated with less acceptance (aOR: 0.15; 95%CI: 0.04, 0.63). For a 50% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker was also associated with greater acceptance, aOR: 1.57; 95%CI: 1.12, 2.20. Conclusion: Acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine was highly influenced by the baseline effectiveness of the vaccine. Preparing the general population to accept a vaccine with relatively low effectiveness may be difficult. © Copyright © 2020 Harapan, Wagner, Yufika, Winardi, Anwar, Gan, Setiawan, Rajamoorthy, Sofyan and Mudatsir.","acceptance; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; vaccination; vaccine",

The earliest infection can be traced back to Wuhan, China. From there it has spread all over the world. Keeping in view the above perspective, an attempt is made in order to find out the epidemiological pattern of COVID 19 pandemic, if any, in different geo-climatological regions of the world in terms of case incidence and mortality. This study is also an endeavor to review and analyze the gradual changes of the genetic makeup of SARS-CoV from evolutionary and epidemiological perspectives. The raw data of COVID-19 cases and death incidences were collected from the World Health Organization (WHO) website from the time period: 1st April to 6th April, 2020. The data that are utilized here for general and Case fatality rate (CFR) based analysis. Western pacific region, European region and Americas have the greatest number of infected cases (P &lt; 0.001); whereas deaths have been found to be significantly higher in Europe (P &lt; 0.001). Total number of confirmed cases and deaths in south-east Asia are comparatively lower (P &lt; 0.001). Case fatality rate (CFR) has also found significant for European region. SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be a strain of SARS-CoV that has a high rate of pathogenicity and transmissibility. Result indicated that the European region has been affected mostly for both cases and death incidences. The novel mutations in SARS-CoV-2 possibly increase the virus infectivity. Genetic heterogeneity of this virus within the human population might originate as the representatives of naturally selected virus quasispecies. In this context, the presence of the asymptomatic individuals could be a significant concern for SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. Further studies are required to understand its genetic evolution and epidemiological significance. © Copyright by Pacini Editore Srl, Pisa, Italy","Changing epidemiology; COVID-19; Evolution; SARS-CoV","Africa; Article; bacterial virulence; case fatality rate; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; disease transmission; Europe; genetic heterogeneity; human; incidence; molecular evolution; nonhuman; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Southeast Asia; Western Hemisphere; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease; Coronavirus infection; epidemiological monitoring; global health; pandemic; virus pneumonia; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemiological Monitoring; Europe; Global Health; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; World Health Organization"

During the lockdown era in Bangladesh at two different time points, from 26−31 March 2020 (early lockdown) and 11−16 May 2020 (late lockdown), two self-administered online surveys were conducted on 1005 respondents (322 and 683 participants, respectively) via social media. To examine risk perception and knowledge-related factors towards COVID-19, univariate and multiple linear regression models were employed. Scores of mean knowledge (8.4 vs. 8.1, p = 0.022) and perception of risk (11.2 vs. 10.6, p < 0.001) differed significantly between early and late lockdown. There was a significant decrease in perceived risk scores for contracting SARS-Cov-2 [β = −0.85, 95% CI: −1.31, −0.39], while knowledge about SARS-Cov-2 decreased insignificantly [β = −0.22, 95% CI: −0.46, 0.03] in late lockdown compared with early lockdown period. Self-quarantine was a common factor linked to increased perceived risks and knowledge of SARS-Cov-2 during the lockdown period. Any effort to increase public awareness and comprehension of SARS-Cov-2 in Bangladesh will then offer preference to males, who did not practice self-quarantine and are less worried about the propagation of this kind of virus. © 2020 by the authors.

This research investigated the recent threat of COVID-19 contagion, especially its impact among frontline paramedics treating patients with COVID-19, and their perception of self-infection, which ultimately increases their agonistic behaviour. Based on the stressor–strain–outcome paradigm, a research model was proposed and investigated using survey-based data through a structured questionnaire. The results found that the perceived threat of COVID-19 contagion (emotional and cognitive threat) was positively correlated with physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion, which led toward agonistic behaviour. Further, perceived social support was a key moderator that negatively affected the relationships between agonistic behaviour and physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion. These findings significantly contributed to the current literature concerning COVID-19 and pandemic-related effects on human behaviour. This study also theorized the concept of human agonistic behaviour, which has key implications for future researchers. © 2020 by the authors.

The disease causes a range of respiratory illnesses, which are fatal. The COVID-19 disease has spread globally and has significantly impacted the health delivery systems, travel regulations, and economic activities and has posed and upsurge of responsibilities for the frontline healthcare workers. Due to the nature of the COVID-19 disease, it has typically caused complications which include pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction together with renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Within a span of just a few months, it has infected more than 4 million peoples across the globe due to its high transmittance rate. Thus, many governments have tried their best to increase the diagnostic capability of their hospitals so that the disease can be identified as early as possible. However, in most cases, the results only come back after a day or two, which directly increases the possibility of disease spreadness because of the delayed diagnosis. Therefore, a fast screening method using existing tools such as x-ray and computerized tomography scans can help alleviate the burden of mass diagnosis tests. A chest x-ray is one of the best modalities in diagnosing a pneumonia symptom, which is the primary symptom for COVID-19. Hence, this paper proposes a lightweight deep learning model to screen the possibility of COVID-19 accurately. A lightweight model is important, as such it allows the model to be deployed on various platforms that include mobile phones, tablets, and normal computers without worrying about the memory storage capacity. The proposed model is based on 14 layers of convolutional neural network with a modified spatial pyramid pooling module. The multiscale ability of the proposed network allows it to identify the COVID-19 disease for various severity levels. According to the performance results, the proposed SPP-COVID-Net achieves the best mean accuracy of 0.946 with the lowest standard deviation among the training folds accuracy. It comprises of just 862,331 total number of parameters, which uses less than 4 MegaBytes memory storage. The model is suitable to be implemented for fast screening purposes so that better-targeted diagnoses can be performed to optimize the test time and cost. © 2020 IEEE.","Compact Deep Learning; COVID-19 Detection; Lightweight Deep Learning Network","Computerized tomography; Convolutional neural networks; Diagnosis; Industrial electronics; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; X rays; Computerized tomography scan; Contagious disease; Delayed diagnosis; Diagnostic capabilities; High transmittance; Learning models; Spatial pyramids; Standard deviation; Deep learning"

Within the span of less than one month, the traditional face-to-face learning has been replaced by online learning to ensure education continuity. This paper sets out to examine online learning readiness among university students who have been thrown in at the deep end. It aims to investigate if demographic factors make any difference in their readiness to learn, online learning experiences and intention to continue using online learning. It also examines their preferred methods of online learning and challenges they face. Data collected from 399 students in two different online learning courses in Malaysia showed that respondents are generally ready for online learning. However, females are found to be more ready than male, degree students are more ready than diploma students while female students and degree students are more satisfied with online learning and have better learning experiences compared to male and diploma students. More than half of the respondents indicated that if given a choice, they do not want to continue with online learning in the future. Most respondents preferred online learning via pre-recorded lectures uploaded to Google Classroom and YouTube. While the biggest challenge for degree students is internet connectivity, for diploma students, it is the difficulty in understanding the content of the subject. Moving forward, government, telecommunication companies and universities should invest in developing internet infrastructure across the country as online learning will be the new norm in the foreseeable future. University also needs to provide further training to enhance academics' online teaching skills to ensure lessons are delivered more effectively. © UiTM Press.","Covid-19; Online learning; Online learning readiness; University students",

Many procedures in the gastrointestinal motility laboratory may be considered moderate to high-risk for viral transmission. Healthcare staff working in gastrointestinal motility laboratories are frequently exposed to splashes, air droplets, mucus, or saliva during the procedures. Moreover, some are aerosol-generating and thus have a high risk of viral transmission. There are multiple guidelines on the practices of gastrointestinal endoscopy during this pandemic. However, such guidelines are still lacking and urgently needed for the practice of gastrointestinal motility laboratories. Hence, the Asian Neurogastroenterology and Motility Association had organized a group of gastrointestinal motility experts and infectious disease specialists to produce a position statement paper based-on current available evidence and consensus opinion with aims to provide a clear guidance on the practices of gastrointestinal motility laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guideline covers a wide range of topics on gastrointestinal motility activities from scheduling a motility test, the precautions at different steps of the procedure to disinfection for the safety and well-being of the patients and the healthcare workers. These practices may vary in different countries depending on the stages of the pandemic, local or institutional policy, and the availability of healthcare resources. This guideline is useful when the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is high. It may change rapidly depending on the situation of the epidemic and when new evidence becomes available. © 2020 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility","COVID-19; Esophageal motility disorders; Gastrointestinal diseases; Gastrointestinal motility; Infection control","anorectal pressure; biofeedback; breath analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; disinfection; emergency ward; esophageal pH monitoring; esophagus function disorder; esophagus manometry; gastrointestinal endoscopy; gastrointestinal motility; gastrointestinal motility disorder; health care availability; health care personnel; high risk patient; human; hypobaric chamber; infection control; infection prevention; infectious disease specialist; laboratory personnel; laboratory test; low risk patient; medical society; multidisciplinary team; organizational policy; pandemic; patient safety; practice guideline; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; urea breath test; virus transmission; wellbeing; workflow"

Methodology: This cross-sectional study was conducted among the health professionals (medical doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, hospital technicians and technologists) providing services at seven hospitals of Punjab province of Pakistan. A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practices regarding COVID-19. Results: All of the participants (N = 429) reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source (65%) of this information. Mean knowledge score was 12 ± 2.1, with 75.5% of participants having satisfactory knowledge. Doctors were found to have significantly better knowledge scores than the other health professionals (p = 0.001). Mean attitude score was 8.0 ± 1.2, with a wide majority of health professionals (86.5%) having positive attitudes. Regarding preventive practices, around 64% reported of always covering nose and mouth with a tissue paper during sneezing or coughing and nearly 65% disposed of the dirty tissue paper in trash bin. Only 40% of the participants reported that 'if they do not have tissue, they cough or sneeze into upper sleeves'. Around 45% reported that they used face mask during their working hours in hospitals nowadays. Mean practice score was 23.3 ± 3.6, with 73.4% of health professionals having satisfactory practices. Conclusions: The overall COVID-19 related KAP of Pakistani health professionals are satisfactory, however some misperceptions and malpractices uncovered in the present study must be addressed to effectively combat COVID-19. © 2020 Salman et al.

We describe here the clinical characteristics and computed tomography (CT) patterns in asymptomatic young patients who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study where 25 male in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz. Demographics, clinical data and CT images of these patients were reviewed by 2 senior radiologists. Results: In total there were 25 patients (all males; mean age [±SD], 21.64±2.40 years; range, 18-27 years). Patients with abnormal chest CT showed a relatively low normal absolute lymphocytes count (median: 2.2 x 109/L) and absolute monocyte count (median: 0.5 x 109/L). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 5 (20%) of the patients. The procalcitonin level was normal while elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, platelet and C-reactive protein were common. Baseline chest CT showed abnormalities in 6 patients. The distribution of the lesions were; upper lobe 3 (12%) lower lobe 3 (12%) with peripheral distribution 4 (16%). Of the 25 patients included, 4 (16%) had ground glass opacification (GGO), 1 (4%) had a small peripheral subpleural nodule, and 1 (4%) had a dense solitary granuloma. Four patients had typical CT features of COVID-19. Conclusion: We found that the CT imaging showed peripheral GGO in our patients. They remained clinically stable with no deterioration of their respiratory symptoms suggesting stability in lung involvement. We postulate that rapid changes in CT imaging may not be present in young, asymptomatic, non-smoking COVID-19 patients. Thus the use of CT thorax for early diagnosis may be reserved for patients in the older age groups, and not in younger patients. © 2020, Malaysian Medical Association.

To date, there is limited evidence on how this infodemic may influence psychobehavioral responses to the crisis. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the psychobehavioral responses to the COVID-19 outbreak and examine their associations with mass and social media exposure. Methods: A cross-sectional study among medical and health sciences students from the Fujian Medical University in Fuzhou, China, was conducted between April 6-22, 2020. Results: A total of 2086 completed responses were received. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that four constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM)-higher perception of susceptibility (odds ratio [OR] 1.44; 95% CI 1.07-1.94), severity (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.10-1.59), self-efficacy (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.21-2.15), and perceived control or intention to carry out prevention measures (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.09-1.59)-were significantly associated with a higher mass media exposure score, whereas only three constructs-higher perception of severity (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.19-1.72), self-efficacy (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.38-2.48), and perceived control or intention to carry out prevention measures (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.08-1.58)-were significantly associated with a higher social media exposure score. Lower emotional consequences and barriers to carry out prevention measures were also significantly associated with greater mass and social media exposure. Our findings on anxiety levels revealed that 38.1% (n=795; 95% CI 36.0-40.2) of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. A lower anxiety level was significantly associated with higher mass and social media exposure in the univariable analyses; however, the associations were not significant in the multivariable analyses. Conclusions: In essence, both mass and social media are useful means of disseminating health messages and contribute to the betterment of psychobehavioral responses to COVID-19. Our findings stress the importance of the credibility of information shared through mass and social media outlets and viable strategies to counter misinformation during a pandemic. © 2020 Yulan Lin, Zhijian Hu, Haridah Alias, Li Ping Wong.","China; COVID-19; Mass media; Medical students; Psychobehavioral; Social media","adult; advertising; anxiety; Article; China; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; disease duration; disease severity; family income; female; Health Belief Model; human; major clinical study; male; mass communication; mass medium; medical student; pilot study; publication; questionnaire; rural area; social media; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; young adult; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; epidemiology; pandemic; social media; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Mass Media; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media; Students, Medical; Young Adult"

Patients with hypertension appear to have a poor prognosis, but there is no direct evidence that hypertension increases the risk of new infection or adverse outcomes independent of age and other risk factors. There is also concern about use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors due to a key role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells. However, there is little evidence that use of RAS inhibitors increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection or worsens the course of COVID-19. Therefore, antihypertensive therapy with these agents should be continued. In addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, patients with severe COVID-19 can develop myocardial injury and cytokine storm, resulting in heart failure, arteriovenous thrombosis, and kidney injury. Troponin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, D-dimer, and serum creatinine are biomarkers for these complications and can be used to monitor patients with COVID-19 and for risk stratification. Other factors that need to be incorporated into patient management strategies during the pandemic include regular exercise to maintain good health status and monitoring of psychological well-being. For the ongoing management of patients with hypertension, telemedicine-based home blood pressure monitoring strategies can facilitate maintenance of good blood pressure control while social distancing is maintained. Overall, multidisciplinary management of COVID-19 based on a rapidly growing body of evidence will help ensure the best possible outcomes for patients, including those with risk factors such as hypertension. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","angiotensin receptor blockers; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; biomarkers; cardiac injury; COVID-19; home blood pressure monitoring; hypertension; telemedicine","amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; creatinine; D dimer; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; thiazide diuretic agent; troponin; biological marker; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; acute coronary syndrome; acute kidney failure; adult respiratory distress syndrome; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure regulation; brain infarction; coronavirus disease 2019; creatinine blood level; cytokine storm; disease severity; health status; heart failure; heart muscle injury; human; hypertension; infection risk; kidney injury; monitoring; outcome assessment; priority journal; prognosis; psychological well-being; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; telemedicine; vein thrombosis; venous thromboembolism; acute kidney failure; adult; aged; Asia; blood; complication; cytokine release syndrome; drug effect; female; genetics; heart failure; hypertension; immunology; interdisciplinary communication; male; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; risk assessment; thrombosis; very elderly; virology; Acute Kidney Injury; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Asia; Biomarkers; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; COVID-19; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Hypertension; Interdisciplinary Communication; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Renin-Angiotensin System; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Thrombosis"

In addition, we report about COVID-19 in health workers in Malaysia. Claims for occupational diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 are recorded separately in a database of the Statutory Accident Insurance and Prevention in the Health and Welfare Services (BGW). This database is analyzed according to its content as of May 22, 2020. In addition, the notifiable cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections from personnel in medical institutions (e.g., clinics and doctor’s office) and social welfare institutions (e.g., nursing homes, shelters and refugee camps) following the German Infection Protection Act are analyzed. The report from Malaysia is based on personal experience and publications of the government. In Germany at present, 4398 suspected case reports for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections among health and social workers have been filed. This figure is four times the number of all reported infections normally received per year. The majority of claims, regardless of being a confirmed infection, concerned nurses (n = 6927, 63.9%). The mortality rate for workers infected with SARS-CoV-2 is 0.2% to 0.5%. Doctors are affected by severe illness more frequently than other occupational groups (8.1% vs. 4.1%). In Malaysia, work-related infection of health workers (HW) occurred mainly when COVID-19 was not suspected in patients and no adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn. Although knowledge on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among workers remains limited, the impact appears to be substantial. This is supported by the mortality rate among infected workers. Occupational health check-ups carried out at the present time should be systematically analyzed in order to gain more information on the epidemiology of COVID-19 among HW. Since the supply and use of PPE improved, the infection risk of HW in Malaysia seems to have decreased. © 2020 by the authors.

What is not yet clear is the impact of environmental factors on susceptibility to getting infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The study aimed to determine associations between air quality, meteorological factors, and COVID-19 cases in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Air pollutants and meteorological data in 2018–2020 were obtained from the Department of Environment Malaysia, while daily new COVID-19 cases in 2020 were obtained from the Ministry of Health Malaysia. Data collected were statistically analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). There were significant differences between PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3, and solar radiation in 2019 and 2020 since movement control order (MCO) was implemented on 18 March 2020. Spearman’s correlation test showed that COVID-19 cases were positively correlated with PM10 (r = 0.131, p &lt; 0.001), PM2.5 (r = 0.151, p &lt; 0.001), SO2 (r = 0.091, p = 0.003), NO2 (r = 0.228, p &lt; 0.001), CO (r = 0.269, p = 0.001), and relative humidity (RH) (r = 0.106, p = 0.001), whereas ambient temperature (AT) was negatively correlated with COVID-19 cases (r = –0.118, p &lt; 0.001). Further, multiple linear regression suggested that NO2 and AT (R2 = 0.071, p &lt; 0.001, f2 = 0.08) were the most significant air pollutant and meteorological factors with weak contribution that influenced the incidence of COVID-19 cases in Kuala Lumpur.

Animal CoVs, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2, rarely infect and spread among humans. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of the resulting disease from this new CoV called ‘COVID-19’, as a ‘public health emergency of international concern’. This global pandemic has affected almost the whole planet and caused the death of more than 315,131 patients as of the date of this article. In this context, publishers, journals and researchers are urged to research different domains and stop the spread of this deadly virus. The increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications has addressed several medical problems. However, such applications remain insufficient given the high potential threat posed by this virus to global public health. This systematic review addresses automated AI applications based on data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19. We aimed to obtain an overview of this critical virus, address the limitations of utilising data mining and ML algorithms, and provide the health sector with the benefits of this technique. We used five databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus and performed three sequences of search queries between 2010 and 2020. Accurate exclusion criteria and selection strategy were applied to screen the obtained 1305 articles. Only eight articles were fully evaluated and included in this review, and this number only emphasised the insufficiency of research in this important area. After analysing all included studies, the results were distributed following the year of publication and the commonly used data mining and ML algorithms. The results found in all papers were discussed to find the gaps in all reviewed papers. Characteristics, such as motivations, challenges, limitations, recommendations, case studies, and features and classes used, were analysed in detail. This study reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques for CoV prediction algorithms based on data mining and ML assessment. The reliability and acceptability of extracted information and datasets from implemented technologies in the literature were considered. Findings showed that researchers must proceed with insights they gain, focus on identifying solutions for CoV problems, and introduce new improvements. The growing emphasis on data mining and ML techniques in medical fields can provide the right environment for change and improvement. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial Intelligence; Biological Data Mining; Coronaviruses; COVID-19; Machine Learning; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2","artificial intelligence; biomedical engineering; classifier; coronavirus disease 2019; data mining; disease severity; epidemic; human; machine learning; medical research; public health; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; algorithm; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; data mining; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Data Mining; Humans; Machine Learning; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral"

Level of student understanding was assessed through a short survey using 35 questions by empowering students' parents. The subjects were 43 students with special needs ranging ages between 7 and 26 old who were taking education in the Special Need School in Kuningan District, Indonesia. This study examined different types of students with special needs (i.e., intellectual disabilities, hearing impairment, visual impairment, physical impairment, and down syndrome). The analysis was supported by the theoretical explanation how the contagion of CoViD-19 virus particles through aerosol droplet. Experimental results showed that most students (62.80%) have understood CoViD-19 virus particles contagion through aerosol droplets, shown by the score achievement of more than 70% correct answer. This study also found that student age did not affect the level of student understanding. The student understanding was supported by their knowledge gained from habituation in learning surrounding environment. Regarding students with low scores, the main problems are their difficulties in focusing on getting knowledge due to their limitations in absorbing complicated and abstract information.

Further, it provided advice to the global community that countries should place strong measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts and promote “social distancing” measures commensurate with the risk. This study analyses the COVID-19 infection data from the top 15 affected countries in which we observed heterogeneous growth patterns of the virus. Hence, this paper applies multifractal formalism on COVID-19 data with the notion that country-specific infection rates follow a power law growth behaviour. According to the estimated generalized fractal dimension curves, the effects of drastic containment measures on the pandemic in India indicate that a significant reduction of the infection rate as its population is concern. Also, comparison results with other countries demonstrate that India has less death rate or more immunity against COVID-19. © 2020, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,
"Prediction of epidemic peak and infected cases for COVID-19 disease in Malaysia, 2020",2020,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086356262&doi=10.3390%2fijerph17114076&partnerID=40&md5=856dcecf42be227e1bf30e3b5395563b","The coronavirus COVID-19 has recently started to spread rapidly in Malaysia. The number of total infected cases has increased to 3662 on 05 April 2020, leading to the country being placed under lockdown. As the main public concern is whether the current situation will continue for the next few months, this study aims to predict the epidemic peak using the Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR) model, with incorporation of the mortality cases. The infection rate was estimated using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), while the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model was used to provide short-time forecasting of the number of infected cases. The results show that the estimated infection rate is 0.228 ± 0.013, while the basic reproductive number is 2.28 ± 0.13. The epidemic peak of COVID-19 in Malaysia could be reached on 26 July 2020, with an uncertain period of 30 days (12 July–11 August). Possible interventions by the government to reduce the infection rate by 25% over two or three months would delay the epidemic peak by 30 and 46 days, respectively. The forecasting results using the ANFIS model show a low Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.041; a low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.45%; and a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9964. The results also show that an intervention has a great effect on delaying the epidemic peak and a longer intervention period would reduce the epidemic size at the peak. The study provides important information for public health providers and the government to control the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2020 by the authors.

However, little is known about public awareness and attitudes regarding COVID-19 in China. The impact of COVID-19 on the societal well-being and anxiety levels of the public has never been documented. The aim of this study was to survey the knowledge, attitudes, impact, and anxiety levels of the people of China in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire was undertaken between Jan 24 and Feb 24, 2020. The study participants were residents of mainland China over the age of 18 years. The attitude items in this study measured the perceived threat of COVID-19 based on the Health Belief Model. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a self-reported questionnaire that measure both state (STAI-S), and trait anxiety (STAI-T) Results: A total of 2,446 completed responses were received. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total knowledge score was 20.3 (SD ± 2.9) out of a possible score of 23. The social disruption and household economic impact were notable, particularly in provinces with higher cumulative confirmed cases. The majority of responses indicated a low perceived susceptibility of being infected (86.7% [95%CI 85.4–88.1]), with a fair proportion of respondents perceiving a higher severity (62.9% [95% CI 61.0–64.8]). The mean total impact score was 9.9 (SD ± 3.8) out of a possible score of 15. The mean score for STAI-S was 48.7 (SD ± 10.8), whereas the mean STAI-T score was 45.7 (SD ± 8.5). By demographics, women reported significantly higher odds for higher levels of both STAI-S (OR = 1.67) and STAI-T (OR = 1.30) compared to men. People of a younger age were also more likely to experience higher STAI-S and STAI-T. Higher perceived susceptibility and severity and impact were strong predictors of higher levels of STAI-S and STAI-T. Conclusion: Our findings can assist in tailoring public communication to change people's knowledge and attitudes. The present study also underlined the importance of the promotion of mental health during infectious disease outbreaks to help in moderating the perceived threat, social and household economic impact, targeting the vulnerable segment of the population. © Copyright © 2020 Lin, Hu, Alias and Wong.","anxiety; attitude; COVID-19; impact; knowledge",

This is presumed due to low immunity associated with other comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity and metabolic syndrome. But the information available on the immune status of COVID-19 patients is limited. Attempts must be made to enhance our understanding of the immune status of COVID-19 patients by revisiting our knowledge on the immune mechanisms of already known coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Early elevation of the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in SARS and MERS infection suggests a possible same type of cytokine storm-mediated lung damage in COVID-19 patients too. Dysregulation of interferon-1 response and downstream cascade in initial innate immune response at virus entry point has been related to lethal pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Adaptive response of increased CD8+ levels in COVID-19 patients seems to be useful in mild cases where it causes deteriorating effects in progressed severe disease patients resulting in destruction of type 2 pneumocytes hence inability to regenerate the alveolar epithelium. A phenomenon called cytokine storm activates violent immunological reactions in the lung tissue resulting in ARDS followed by multiple organ system damages in COVID-19 patients. Several immune evading mechanisms are thought to be employed by severe respiratory syndrome virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that might have resulted in its extremely increased contagiousness probably related with its frequent RNA mutations. Failure to develop adequate virus limiting immune reactions by some cured patients warrant monitoring of all recovered patients. This rapid mini review is aimed to enhance our knowledge of the immune status of COVID-19 infected patients with reference to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. © The Author(s) 2020.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Immune status; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV","CD8 antigen; cytokine; interferon; RNA; adaptive immunity; adult respiratory distress syndrome; blood level; cardiovascular disease; cell destruction; cell regeneration; comorbidity; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; deterioration; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; gene mutation; human; hypertension; immune dysregulation; immune evasion; immune response; immune status; immunocompromised patient; innate immunity; lethality; lung alveolus cell type 2; lung injury; lung parenchyma; metabolic syndrome X; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; morbidity; mortality; multiple organ failure; nonhuman; obesity; pandemic; pneumonia; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus entry"

Public understanding, including knowledge about signs and symptoms, mode of transmission, and hygiene of COVID-19, is vital for designing effective control strategies during a public health crisis. The current study is aimed at investigating the public’s perspective about COVID-19, including their knowledge, attitude, and practices. Methods: A rapid online survey comprising 22 items was administered during the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan. Questions were focused on the prevention, transmission, clinical features, and control of COVID-19. In addition, the attitudes and practices of the participants were explored. Descriptive statistics, Mann–Whitney tests, Kruskal–Wallis tests, and regression analysis were carried out during data analysis. Results: A total of 1257 respondents participated in this study. Most of the respondents had good knowledge (good = 64.8%, average = 30.5%, poor = 4.7%) of COVID-19. Gender, marital status, education, and residence were observed to have a significant association with the knowledge score. A vast majority of the survey respondents (77.0%) believed that COVID-19 would be controlled successfully in Pakistan. The practices of wearing a mask (85.8%) and handwashing (88.1%) were common among the participants. Conclusion: The participants demonstrated good knowledge and reasonable attitudes and practices toward most aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak.

What has emerged is the need for finding an efficient, quick and accurate method to mitigate the overloading of radiologists' efforts to diagnose the suspected cases. This study presents the combination of deep learning of extracted features with the Q-deformed entropy handcrafted features for discriminating between COVID-19 coronavirus, pneumonia and healthy computed tomography (CT) lung scans. In this study, pre-processing is used to reduce the effect of intensity variations between CT slices. Then histogram thresholding is used to isolate the background of the CT lung scan. Each CT lung scan undergoes a feature extraction which involves deep learning and a Q-deformed entropy algorithm. The obtained features are classified using a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network classifier. Subsequently, combining all extracted features significantly improves the performance of the LSTM network to precisely discriminate between COVID-19, pneumonia and healthy cases.

Even though COVID-19 infection may be just severe in any adults, older adults (65-year-old or older) may experience a higher mortality rate. Among those affected, cancer patients may have a worse outcome compared to the general population because of their depressed immune status. As the health resources of most countries are limited, clinicians may face painful decisions about which patients to save if they require artificial ventilation. Cancer patients, especially the older ones, may be denied supportive care because of their shorter life expectancy. Thus, special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer treatment. The following proposal was reached: (1) Education of health care providers about the special needs of older cancer patients and their risks of infection. (2) Special consideration such as surgical masks and separate scheduling should be made to protect them from being infected. (3) Social services such as patient navigators should be provided to ensure adequate medical supply, food, and daily transportation to cancer centers. (4) Close monitoring through phone calls, telecommunication to ensure social distancing and psychological support from patient family to prevent anxiety and depression. (5) Shorter course of radiotherapy by use of hypofractionation where possible to decrease the needs for daily transportation and exposure to infection. (6) Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral medications if infection does occur. (7) Home health care telemedicine may be an effective strategy for older cancer patients with COVID-19 infection to avoid hospital admission when health care resources become restricted. (8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors.

The survey instrument consisted of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 3 items on attitudes and 3 items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 80.5%. Most participants held positive attitudes toward the successful control of COVID-19 (83.1%), the ability of Malaysia to conquer the disease (95.9%) and the way the Malaysian government was handling the crisis (89.9%). Most participants were also taking precautions such as avoiding crowds (83.4%) and practising proper hand hygiene (87.8%) in the week before the movement control order started. However, the wearing of face masks was less common (51.2%). This survey is among the first to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The results highlight the importance of consistent messaging from health authorities and the government as well as the need for tailored health education programs to improve levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices. © 2020 Azlan et al.

As the case count amongst children is low, there is need to report COVID-19 in children to better understand the virus and the disease. Cases: In Malaysia, until end of February 2020, there were four COVID-19 paediatric cases with ages ranging from 20 months to 11 years. All four cases were likely to have contracted the virus in China. The children had no symptoms or mild flu-like illness. The cases were managed symptomatically. None required antiviral therapy. Discussion: There were 2 major issues regarding the care of infected children. Firstly, the quarantine of an infected child with a parent who tested negative was an ethical dilemma. Secondly, oropharyngeal and nasal swabs in children were at risk of false negative results. These issues have implications for infection control. Consequently, there is a need for clearer guidelines for child quarantine and testing methods in the management of COVID-19 in children. © 2020 The Author(s)","Coronavirus; COVID-19; epidemic; Epidemiology; nCoV; Outbreak; Paediatric","loratadine; paracetamol; penicillin V; salbutamol; Article; asthma; asymptomatic infection; case report; child; China; clinical article; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; female; fever; human; Malaysia; male; nose smear; oral rehydration therapy; preschool child; quarantine; real time polymerase chain reaction; rhinorrhea; school child; thorax radiography; throat culture; wheezing; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; infant; isolation and purification; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infant; Malaysia; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral"

In addition, the results have showed some of these negative effects, most specifically post-traumatic stress syndrome, could have an effect on long-term people and could be more important among those with a history of mental disorder and related healthcare providers. Due to this latest COVID-19 pandemic, several nations, including Malaysia, have urged citizens to quarantine at home or at the quarantine centre. Those are among the causes that influence the degree of psychological effect on those engaged in quarantine, such as the amount of time spent in quarantine, feelings of fatigue, anger and anxiety, lack of resources such as food, water and clothes, loss of family members and love; and loss of productive knowledge. Losing income and profits owing to cessation of job or unemployed, and the stigma and guilt about getting sick or getting others sick are always viewed as something shameful and linked to mental wellbeing problems. Therefore, this research endeavours to develop a coherent regulatory mechanism which can be used to analyse the ways in order to minimise negative mental health status in the present pandemic, quarantine should last no longer than necessary; health authorities should give clear guidance and ample services to those who are impacted by quarantine. Often, healthcare staff are required to receive medical help from their supervisors, and those with pre-existing mental illness will require additional assistance through this quarantine time. In China, China's National Health Commission has called an immediate request for psychiatric distress action and has established numerous legislation and psychosocial mental wellbeing and frameworks. This condition varies from nation to nation. In Malaysia, it is arguable thatThe absence and lack of mental health and psychosocial regulatory structures, scarcity of well-trained mental health practitioners, and lack of active expert interventions (NGOs, health institutions, state municipal participation, academic sectors) could importantly affect the communities. Hence, there is an urgent need to create a robust and effective guidance that magnifies the risks of long-term psychological distress impact. Having said that, public mental health monitoring should therefore be considered as part of epidemic monitoring which may help detect potential problems. These later contribute to a forum in a way to formulate an effective solution to public mental wellbeing, and help address concerns or dilemmas that happened among pre-existing psychological illness families, during or after the outbreak of COVID-19. Ignorance of the pandemic's effect on mental wellbeing problems would not only hamper efforts to deter further dissemination of COVID-19, it would also inflate current health gaps. © 2020 SERSC.","COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic outbreak; Regulatory mechanisms.��",

But this action is not really effective even it might cause the spread of the coronavirus from the infectious people to the person who does the screening process. In order to solve this issue, the fast and precise identification of coronavirus is needed. The aim of this study is to design a system that has capability to detect the coronavirus automatically from the thermal image fast with less human interactions using IoT based smart glasses technology. Furthermore, the proposed design has capability to perform face detection on suspected case of Covid-19 among crowds who has high body temperature.

COVID-19 outbreak is having a gigantic impact to the aviation players. The aviation and tourism industry worldwide are experiencing gloomy downturn of business. As reported by International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global revenue of airlines industry is estimated to reduce by around USD113 billion. For every 100 cases of COVID-19, it will lead to drop on passenger demand which cost universal airlines nearly USD113 billion. Apart from it, COVID-19 also hit shipping and air freight industry. The air freight business is dropped tremendously due to COVID-19 as a result from the cancellation of thousands of passenger flights from all countries across the globe, especially China. The cancellation of flights again results to lessening of belly capacity for cargo. With this background, this study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 to the aviation players. This exploratory study opts for abductive research approach. Published secondary data were used to get key information about COVID-19 and its impact to the global aviation players. The analysis of the key challenges and the outcome are based on content analysis performed in this study. This study specifically explores key impact of COVID-19 to the wide spectrum aviation players namely the airlines, airport authority, the air cargo provider, in-flight food caterer, aircraft or spare parts manufacturers, as well as the MROs (maintenance, repair and overhaul organization). This study is among the pioneer that investigate COVID-19 in the aviation sector. The findings from this study would lead to big areas of research for future scholars. This study also offers a toolkit reference to the aviation practitioners, as well as policy makers to further improve the policy or guideline relating to epidemic or pandemic issue in transportation industry. © 2020 SERSC.","Air Cargo; Airline; Airline Catering; Airport; Aviation; COVID-19; Pandemic disease",

The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, believed to have originated from infected bats, is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus. Specifically, the overall genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13. Although the current mortality rate of 2% is significantly lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (35%), SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of up to 24 days. Some statistical studies have shown that, on average, one infected patient may lead to a subsequent 5.7 confirmed cases. Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, China, there has been a total of 60,412 confirmed cases with 1370 fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of February 13, 2020. The outbreak has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels. This paper is a review of the significant, continuous global effort that was made to respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days. Although no vaccines have been discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients. On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate. This review aims to critically summarize the most recent advances in understanding the coronavirus, as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment. © 2020 by the authors.

COVID-19 which is also called as 2019-nCov is caused by the novel coronavirus and it is spread by the salivary droplets or nasal discharge released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In the current COVID-19 scenario, the face mask is designed to ameliorate the prevention of airborne transmission of the novel coronavirus. The use of face mask is competent only when the other personal preventive measures are ide-ally pursued. The effectiveness of the use of face mask depends strongly on the do’s and don’ts which has to followed while wearing a face mask. The purpose of this study is to analyze and summarize the published literature associated with the types, usage, risks, limitations, disposal and reusability of face mask. The availability of medication and treatment options are sparse and the development of vaccines for COVID-19 is going to take a longer time. Hence the most effective strategy to curb the spread of the disease is by the judicious use of face mask along with other personal protective measures. © 2020, J. K.

Early recognition of the trend and pattern of the chain of transmission is necessary to slow down the spread. AIM: Therefore, the study aimed to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a local setting. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was done to all COVID-19 cases registered in Seremban Health District. Statistical analysis, using Chi-square test, was employed to compare the sociodemographic characteristic of COVID-19 patients between the red zone area and the non-red zone area in Seremban. RESULTS: As of April, a total of 214 number of COVID-19 cases reported in Seremban district alone. The trend of cases registered has changed as more asymptomatic infection outnumbered patients with clinical symptoms from the aggressive active case detection (ACD) activity. Majority of the cases affecting Malay ethnicity were due to a large religious gathering event held 1 month earlier than subsequently spread the infection within the community. CONCLUSION: The first wave of COVID-19 cases in Seremban was sudden and unexpected, with a skewed distribution affecting a particular race group regardless red zone area and non-red zone area. Therefore, identifying the pattern of infection in the local community is important for a focused intervention strategy. ACD strategy, isolation of patients, quarantine the exposed, tracking down the close contact, and continuous health promotion and education will ultimately break the chain of transmission. © 2020 Mohd ‘Ammar Ihsan Ahmad Zamzuri, Farah Edura Ibrahim, Muhammad Alimin Mat Reffien, Mohd Fathulzhafran Mohamed Hanan, Muhamad Hazizi Muhamad Dasani, Noor Khalili Mohd Ali, Hasanain Faisal Ghazi, Mohd Rohaizat Hassan.","Coronavirus disease-19; Epidemiology; Malaysia; Seremban; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","adult; Article; case fatality rate; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; epidemic; epidemiological data; ethnicity; female; health care personnel; human; incidence; Malaysia; male; middle aged; nose smear; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; throat culture; virus transmission; young adult"

Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine was an adopted recent justification depending on its non-specific immune activation properties. Still the problem of post-vaccine short duration of protection needs to be solved. The same protective mechanism was identified in active or latent tuberculosis (TB). For each single patient of active TB, there are about nine cases of asymptomatic latent TB apparently normal individuals living within the community without restrictions carrying benefits of immune activation and involved in re-infection cycles in an excellent example of repeated immunity training sessions of the whole community. AIM: We aimed to asses the correlation between TB burden and COVID-19 mortality in all affected countries having different BCG vaccination policies. METHODS: Publicly available data were extracted for 191 countries including population size, TB estimations, national BCG vaccination policy, the World Health Organization regions and economic classification, and COVID-19 mortality and number of cases. The analysis was performed using Spearman’s correlation test. RESULTS: Significant large negative correlation (−0.539, p < 0.001) was found between TB prevalence and COVID-19 mortality rate worldwide. Medium negative significant correlations were found between TB cases and COVID-19 mortality in the high and lower middle-income countries, and those having current BCG vaccination programs (−0.395, p = 0.001, −0.365, p = 0.015, and −0.476, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Countries with high TB prevalence have higher chances of protection against COVID-19 mortality through the theory of widely distributed natural immune activation within community.

Since its inception, the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) has become the “topic of interest” in most academic conferences across the world. However, there seem to be inconclusive and non-consensual agreement among researchers as to what the concept of IR 4.0 entails. Additionally, differing opinions exist among researchers on the technological components of this revolution. Although, scholars have rooted for technologies as a major solution for the resilience on the impacts of COVID-19 on the hospitality and tourism industry, few studies have thoroughly explored these technologies for the industry. Using a critical review process, we address these gaps and present a unified typology of IR 4.0 technologies for the hospitality and tourism industry. This review conclusively theorises IR 4.0 technologies and proposes a 6-component typology of IR 4.0 as well as their opportunities for the hospitality and tourism industry.

In the dental setting, oral decontamination could be an important adjunct to personal protective equipment and is recommended by a number of national COVID-19 guidance documents for dental settings. Aim To assess the in vitrovirucidal activity of an oral povidone iodine (PVP-I) product against SARS-CoV-2. Material and methods BETADINE gargle and mouthwash (1% PVP-I) was tested against SARS-CoV-2 virus under both clean and dirty conditions using a suspension assay based on EN14476 methodology. Virucidal activity of the product, undiluted and at 1:2 dilution, was tested at contact times of 15, 30 and 60 seconds. Viral titres were calculated using the Spearman-Kärber method and reported as median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50/ml). Results The undiluted product achieved &gt;5 log10 reduction in viral titres compared to the control at 15, 30 and 60 seconds under both clean and dirty conditions. At a twofold dilution (0.5% PVP-I), the test product demonstrated &gt;4 log10 kill at 15 seconds and &gt;5 log10 kill at 30 and 60 seconds in both clean and dirty conditions. Conclusion PVP-I gargle and mouthwash product, undiluted and at 1:2 dilution, demonstrated potent and rapid virucidal activity (≥4 log10 reduction of viral titre) in 15 seconds against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The PVP-I gargle and mouthwash product is widely available and could be readily integrated into infection control measures during dental treatment including pre-procedural oral decontamination. © 2020, British Dental Association.",,

Students have been staying in hostels or houses, unable to go to university campuses. This situation has left university administrators no choice, but to have an online learning channel. Malaysian universities in particular have gone through many challenges to bring their online learning system up and ready to resume education process. However, students have found themselves caught in this situation (pure online learning) with no plan or readiness. Literature reviews showed that students encountered some challenges that could not be easily resolved. This study explored the challenges encountered by students of a government-linked university. This university is one of the largest in Malaysia with over 10 campuses across the country. This study collected 284 valid answers. The findings show that respondents lacked full readiness in this situation physically, environmentally, and psychologically with some differences in perspectives according to their gender, age, and residing state. Respondents were concerned about the implications of lockdown on their performance.

As of 14th July 2020, the pandemic recorded 12,964,809 confirmed cases with 570,288 deaths globally. A thorough review of the clinical characteristics of this infection will help in understanding this widespread but seemingly localizing disease. This research aimed to review the clinical characteristic of Covid-19 including the risk factors, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological findings and complications exhibited in Asia. A narrative review was conducted along with 48 research articles published in Scopus journals in 2020 in Asian countries on clinical characteristics of the disease. It was concluded that despite being in the same region, clinical characteristics of COVID-19 varies among the Asian countries. The mortality rate among Asian countries was varied with the competency of public health measures as one of the vital contributing factors. The variable findings on the clinical characteristics may be due to inconsistent quality of methodology in recent researches which was a rapid response to the pandemic. Although these studies are necessary to manage the current global emergency, more high-quality researches are needed to provide a valid and reliable scientific understanding of the disease. © 2020, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

Why did these recognized healthcare systems fail to face the pandemic and why other systems could do it? This should be studied and known well to be used for future planning of healthcare strategies in case this pandemic to reactivated or any other pandemic to reveal at any time. Mitigation strategies are very important to limit the spread of the pandemic. So, the aim of this study is to review and analyse the mitigation strategies that have been practiced during previous pandemics. This research reviewed the strategy of social distancing, global containment measures, herd immunity and mass testing. It was concluded that, although social distancing is very important in decreasing the spread of epidemic, having specific vaccination is paramount. Meanwhile, it should be remembered that in the absence of proper vaccination, ‘herd immunity’ is the most effective policy to counteract the spread of the disease in the community. On the other hand, herd immunity is a challenging strategy that must be strictly controlled otherwise would be disastrous. In all cases transparency and trust should be built with the public to preserve calmness and compliance to the mitigation measures. © 2020, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

However, procedures for the selection of intervention and Tele-acupressure self-practice implementation techniques are lacking. This lack of information hinders further studies on the effect of Tele-acupressure self-practice and its subsequent clinical uses. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Tele-acupressure self-practice on the improvement of mental health as well as depression, anxiety and well-being during COVID-19 in Malaysia. Methods: The goal of this work was to manage Tele-acupressure self-practice for mental health during COVID-19. All the participants (N=80) enrolled in this study were staying at one of the same communities. The participants were randomly allocated to one of the two groups; 40 participants were involved in the Tele-acupressure self-practice group, and 40 participants were involved in the Nonacupressure group. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and personal well-being (using the four Office for National Statistics personal well-being questions, ONS-4) were used to assess measurement. Data were collected at baseline and after four weeks of treatment. Results: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (6.29±1.65), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (7.20±0.65), anxiety score in well-being ONS-4 (3.34±0.38) were significantly lower; the happiness score in well-being ONS-4 (8.82±0.86) was significantly higher in the Tele-acupressure self-practice group compared with the Non-acupressure group in the after four week’s assessments. The two groups were not statistically different regarding satisfaction with life and sorthwhile in the well-being ONS-4 questionnaires. Conclusions: Tele-acupressure self-practice had an effect than Non-acupressure in participants during COVID-19 pandemic. But, satisfaction with life and worthwhile in the well-being was better in both of the groups, which proved the participants became more relaxed.

How people across different ages and income groups are mentally and physically adjusting to the unprecedented situation in Malaysia is yet to be documented. Hence, an empirical study was conducted to capture this real-time situation during COVID-19 MCO. Objective: To describe the mental and emotional wellbeing of Malaysians and how they care for themselves and their family during the COVID-19 pandemic and during MCO. Methods: A survey on 3,288 respondents was conducted towards the end of the first phase of MCO. The questionnaire was administered through various online social media platforms using snowball and convenience sampling. Results: About 90% of the respondents gave their priority to health needs and in providing food, shel-ter and clothing for their family, while education is at the bottom of their priority list. The overall index of mental wellbeing and emotional stability went beyond 57% up to 95%, indicating that people are mentally and emotionally disturbed with COVID-19. The index ranges between 49% up until 90% in the ability to care for themselves and family. Conclusion: Health needs were at the top of the priority list of the high income group and least in the low income group. While for the low income group, the top most priority concerns their financial sta-bility. Education was given the least priority by all income groups. Their greatest fear is the infection of COVID-19 that would harm their family’s health. They were also stressed with the COVID-19 pandemic that could affect the Malaysian economy and thus worried about losing their sources of income if this pandemic prolongs over an indefinite period. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Health; MCO; Mental and emotional wellbeing; Pandemic","hand sanitizer; adult; anxiety; Article; convenience sample; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; education; emotional stability; emotional wellbeing; female; gender; government; highest income group; household income; human; immune system; lowest income group; major clinical study; Malaysian; male; middle aged; pandemic; psychological well-being; questionnaire; risk factor; safety; sample size; snowball sample; social distancing; social media; young adult"

Although men are primarily detected to be slightly more vulnerable in succumbing to the ongoing COVID-19 contagion, many researchers have recognized that women are facing more of the devastating brunt in secondary terms. Aside gendered health and social impacts, women are more disproportionately disadvantaged than men in economic terms, as they are predominantly found in the part-time and informal occupations, which have been closed down for months now since the emergence of the current global crisis. Also, since women form the vast proportion of the caregivers within the health sector, their role in handling the pandemic as frontline respondents at the hospitals put them in higher risks of contracting the disease. Despite this higher risk of infection, the peculiar attentions to women’s health in the planning and rolling out of actions to contain the virus have been overlooked. Additionally, their unpaid domestic care works have also increased due to closure of schools and businesses, which have forced family members to stay at home for as long as movement control orders remain in place. In this confined state, the domestic violence against women have been recorded to be on the increase. To recommend measures that consider gendered dimensions of the current crisis, we have reviewed the various sex-based burdens and impacts of the pandemic, and proceeded to suggest necessary response actions to handle the situation.

The search was made using PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Articles published between January 2020 and October 2020 and written in the English language were retrieved and included in the study. Researches that used traditional medicine, in-vitro and invivo animal studies, as well as reviews were excluded. Seventy-three relevant articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were finally selected and reviewed. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin produced no clinical evidence of efficacy in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT). However, retrospective observational studies reported the efficacy of remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir in reducing viral load, although there have been concerns with lopinavir/ritonavir and, more recently, remdesivir. Recently, tocilizumab, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone significantly relieved lung inflammation and decreased mortality in patients with severe COVID-19. In addition, convalescent plasma was effective in boosting strong immunity among patients with mild COVID-19. There is currently no single worldwide approved therapeutic option for patients with COVID-19 despite the initial hype with medicines, including hydroxychloroquine. Nonetheless, dexamethasone has shown promise in symptomatic treatment and convalescent plasma in boosting immunity.

"Ace2 role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and covid-19 severity",2020,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099074155&partnerID=40&md5=ac84c2d0aa3a5b6e718d87e734c2ff70","In 2003, it was discovered that the entry receptor for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a protein called the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This protein is present in a number of cell types, including those from the respiratory tract. Soon after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the disease Covid-19, scientists found that ACE2 was also used by the new coronavirus to infect cells. This opened some interesting possibilities to explain the striking variation in risks of catching and dying from Covid-19. The best recognised of these are the much higher risk of serious illness in older than younger people, in men than women, and in those with pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. There are several ways in which the ACE2 protein might contribute to this variation. The most obvious would be if there is more ACE2, there would be more entry points for the virus to infect the cell, e.g. in older people or in men. However, the evidence for this is rather small, partly because it is not that easy to obtain representative healthy tissues. Alternatively, it could be related to ACE2 membership of a family of proteins that has one end of the protein anchored inside the cell while most of the protein protrudes from the outside of the cell which therefore can be shed when cleaved by proteases at the cell membrane. Herein we review current evidence and theories of ACE2 role on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and Covid-19 severity. © 2020, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

This paper focuses on the utilization of a clinical practice protocol for identifying HCWs who are COVID-19-positive or under investigation and surveillance for suspected infection, in a tertiary, university teaching hospital of Malaysia. The protocol for Psychological First Aid (PFA), which is applied remotely via a mobile application and phone calls, outlines the work process in stages, with expected immediate, intermediate, and long-term goals within a “Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Realistic Timeframe” (SMART). This protocol is developed to provide a guideline for psychological crisis interventions that promote safety, calm, and hope in HCWs, allowing them to return to psychological functioning without being stigmatized. The unprecedented remote PFA protocol may serve as a platform for further research on the application of a goal-directed approach in a healthcare organization. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper specifically explores the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on religious tourism and aims to enhance the literature; it also aims to provide a path for future research work, in particular empirical research or future research that covers the effects of this pandemic on destinations. This paper is built on the fusion of news published by different news agencies to support an overview of related literature on religious tourism and tourism management. This paper confirms that COVID-19 has affected religious travellers worldwide. The rapid spread of the virus and international travel restrictions by many countries are important factors. To drive future tourism activities, new forms of tourism like smart tourism need to be introduced. These changes will force businesses to reevaluate service design and distribution channels. Industry professionals and policymakers should concentrate on tailoring travel plant to the experiences of tourists. The recommendations can help to relive outbreak-related tension, deliver newly elevated experiences to tourists, and partially mitigate the impact of COVID- 19 on the religious tourism industry. These recommendations can also apply to the global tourism industry more broadly. Tourism scholars and practitioners should give proper consideration to this tragedy and how it might inform industry and social practices. This and other public health crises provide sterling opportunities for the industry to observe its effects on the environment, climate, and travellers themselves in a holistic way. This paper probably represents a frontier review, analysing critically the likely effects of COVID-19 on religious tourism practices in the coming future. Along with this it also represents the effect of COVID-19 on other industries e.g. hotel and airline, which are the supporting hand of the tourism industry. © International Journal of Religious Tourism and Pilgrimage","COVID-19; Impacts; Religious tourism; Tourism destination",

METHODS: An online well-structured and validated faculty self-perceived competency questionnaire was used to collect responses from medical faculty. The questionnaire consisted of four purposely build sections on competence in student engagement, instructional strategy, technical communication and time management. The responses were recorded using a Likert ordinal scale (1-9). The Questionnaire was uploaded at www.surveys.google.com and the link was distributed through social media outlets and e-mails. Descriptive statistics and Independent paired t-test were used for analysis and comparison of quantitative and qualitative variables. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 738 responses were assessed. Nearly 54% (397) participants had less than 5 years of teaching experience, 24.7% (182) had 6-10 years and 11.7% (86) had 11-15 years teaching expertise. 75.6% (558) respondents have delivered online lectures during the pandemic. Asynchronous methods were used by 61% (450) and synchronous by 39% (288) of participants. Moreover, 22.4% (165) participants revealed that their online lectures were evaluated by a structured feedback from experts, while 38.3% participants chose that their lectures were not evaluated. A significant difference (p<0.01) was found between FSPC scores and online teaching evaluation by experts. The mean score of FSPC scale was 5.62±1.15. The mean score for student's engagement, instructional strategies, technical communication and time management were of 5.18±1.60, 5.67±1.61, 5.49±1.71 and 6.12±1.67 respectively.

The study sample targeted several international financial reports that were amended based on epidemic conditions. The revised financial reporting period provides standardized reporting procedures for financial transactions worldwide despite the pandemic. Therefore, IFRS has been used to reduce challenges in financial reporting by monitoring the duration of social distancing while reporting matters to eliminate confirmed uncertainty and judgment. After analyzing the data obtained through global search engines, the results conducted provided evidence that COVID-19 affects financial reporting in companies around the world. Therefore, companies face difficulty reporting finances based on the challenging environment that the pandemic represents. Besides, IFRS fair value measurements consider the prices that were predicted according to current market values.

Aims In this multicentre study, we compared the psychological outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in various countries in the Asia-Pacific region and identified factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Method From 29 April to 4 June 2020, the study recruited healthcare workers from major healthcare institutions in five countries in the Asia-Pacific region. A self-administrated survey that collected information on prior medical conditions, presence of symptoms, and scores on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) relating to COVID-19 was compared, and multivariable logistic regression identified independent factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes within each country. Results A total of 1146 participants from India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam were studied. Despite having the lowest volume of cases, Vietnam displayed the highest prevalence of PTSD. In contrast, Singapore reported the highest case volume, but had a lower prevalence of depression and anxiety. In the multivariable analysis, we found that non-medically trained personnel, the presence of physical symptoms and presence of prior medical conditions were independent predictors across the participating countries. Conclusions This study highlights that the varied prevalence of psychological adversity among healthcare workers is independent of the burden of COVID-19 cases within each country. Early psychological interventions may be beneficial for the vulnerable groups of healthcare workers with presence of physical symptoms, prior medical conditions and those who are not medically trained. © The Author(s), 2020.

Risk assessment included hazard identification, evaluation of existing control level at the workplace, estimation of likelihood and severity of hazard, risk determination, and control measure recommen-dations. Five waste collection activities were identified and reviewed. High-risk exposure includes collection of garbage, mechanical manipulation of compactor lorries and unloading of garbage at the disposal site. There is poor practice of personal hygiene and unestablished continuous monitoring of personal pro-tective equipment supplies. The preventive measures in the waste collection industry are influenced by several factors.

As the challenge continues to remain the current study seeks to examine the factors affecting social distancing through space planning and management. More specifically the current study aims to examine the appropriateness of the spatial organization and space configuration of a clubhouse with a linear plan layout in the mitigation of the spread of infections due to serious pandemic COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: For an enhanced understanding of the impact of spatial arrangements of public spaces plan on the effective implementation of social distancing this study has used the space syntax analysis method. The MPSP clubhouse building in Penang, Malaysia was selected as the case study. The level of permeability and wayfinding were determined in the building plan and were illustrated using photoshop software to depict the interrelation between the indoor spaces and building circulation. Graphs of the depth of space were used to analyze the level of permeability and wayfinding to illustrate the possibility of social distancing in the plan. Findings: The result of the study shows the significant role of proper plan layout design on social distancing. While clear and direct wayfinding can positively be associated with more effective social distancing, the inefficient design of user access, inappropriate locations of multiple entry and exit and indefinite directions of users' inside buildings can impose slight limitations. The average level of permeability might suggest ineffective spatial arrangement, ignoring the needs of spatial segregation. The study further found that the linear plan layouts with proper zoning and effective management strategies can be considered a proper layout to facilitate social distancing and the spread of COVID-19. Originality/value: The current study is unique in terms of examination of the spatial configuration of linear public spaces plan layout for possible temporary adaptability to curb disease spread during the unexpected advent of a pandemic. Based on researchers' best of knowledge it is the first time that the impact of recreational space design on social distancing has been examined. The study also originally sheds light on the fact that the commonly used guideline for the social distancing of 1–2 m between 2 persons, in reality, is practically inadequate given the nature of the sports activities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptability; Permeability; Social distancing; Space and function management; Space syntax; Wayfinding","Buildings; Syntactics; Design/methodology/approach; Disease prevention; Effective management; Space configuration; Spatial arrangements; Spatial configuration; Spatial organization; Spatial segregation; Economic and social effects"

Hyperinflammation-induced lung damage is one of the poor prognostic indicators causing a higher rate of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. Favipiravir, an antiviral drug, is being used for COVID-19 treatment, and we currently have limited information regarding its efficacy and safety. Thus, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the adverse drug events (ADEs) reported in the WHO pharmacovigilance database. Methods: This study analyzed all suspected ADEs related to favipiravir reported from 2015. The reports were analyzed based on age, gender, and seriousness of ADEs at the System Organ Classification (SOC) level and the individual Preferred Term (PT) level. Results: This study is based on 194 ADEs reported from 93 patients. Most frequent ADEs suspected to be caused by the favipiravir included increased hepatic enzymes, nausea and vomiting, tachycardia, and diarrhea. Severe and fatal ADEs occurred more frequently in men and those over the age of 64 years. Blood and lymphatic disorders, cardiac disorders, hepatobiliary disorders, injury poisoning, and procedural complications were more common manifestations of severe ADEs. Conclusion: This study revealed that favipiravir appears to be a relatively safe drug. An undiscovered anti-inflammatory activity of favipiravir may explain the improvement in critically ill patients and reduce inflammatory markers. Currently, the data is based on very few patients. A more detailed assessment of the uncommon ADEs needs to be analyzed when more information will be available. © 2020 Kaur et al.","Adverse drug events; Assumed; Described; Favipiravir; Record; SARS-Cov-2; Scrutiny; Usage; World health organization","favipiravir; abdominal pain; acute kidney failure; adult; age distribution; anemia; arthritis; Article; asthenia; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; bradycardia; bronchospasm; clinical feature; colitis; congenital disorder; constipation; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cystic fibrosis; data base; diarrhea; disease severity; dizziness; drug eruption; drug fatality; drug hypersensitivity; drug induced disease; drug safety; drug use; dyspnea; erythema; eye disease; faintness; female; fever; gastrointestinal disease; genetic disorder; hair disease; headache; heart palpitation; hematologic disease; hepatobiliary disease; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; hypertransaminasemia; hypotension; immunopathology; leukopenia; liver dysfunction; liver toxicity; lymphatic system disease; maculopapular rash; major clinical study; male; mediastinum disease; metabolic disorder; muscle spasm; musculoskeletal disease; musculoskeletal pain; nail disease; nausea and vomiting; neurologic disease; nutritional disorder; pharmacovigilance; pruritus; purpura; QT prolongation; respiratory distress; respiratory tract disease; rhabdomyolysis; seizure; sex difference; skin manifestation; soft tissue disease; tachycardia; thorax disease; thrombocytopenia; urinary tract disease; urticaria; vasculitis; visual impairment; World Health Organization"

The focus is that of an investigator concerned with Iran’s security and specific services used to process civil interactions. Game Theory dynamics affect uncertainty, proxy wars and the complex geopolitics of the Middle East. This often requires key players to focus on security by any means at their disposal. The maintenance of Iran’s autonomy and political security all too often require opposition to circumstances and players even while under heavy sanctions. This study seeks to answer the following questions: 1. Was this event actually a threat from the west, specifically from the US? 2. Was there an internal criminal element operating in Iran? 3. What was the nature of Iran’s response politically and socially concerning the pandemic? These objectives initially concern scrutinizing the extent of terrorist or criminal violations identified by Western authorities regarding Iran’s hegemonic involvement, particularly in Iraq. Secondly, we examine impacts from the Coronavirus threat that changed Iran’s focus in response to the US politically, and on her ability to effectively manage the COVID-19 contagion internally. Thirdly, the epidemic’s effects on Iranians. The investigation draws on literature and facts to analyze these impacts. The pandemic threatened Iran’s social and political stability and served to further distance the government from its people. This is, therefore, treated as a serious condition with potentially exponential effects on national security. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2020.","Assasination of General Soleimani; COVID-19 in Iran; Health Security in Iran; Security Threat for Iran; Terrorism; US-Iran Relations",

Some e-learning media that are generally used based on survey results include 53.81% google classrooms combined with other applications that are not integrated with the institution’s Learning Management System. This condition provides research opportunities to evaluate the effectiveness of online learning, especially how students are motivated to learn the method, where the results can be used as a reference in developing and refining the method. Based on many studies, that the gamification model can increase individual motivation in carrying out activities, this study uses a gamification octalysis framework to analyze the extent of the role of gamification in the learning process and measure the amount of student motivation in online learning activities. The evaluation results show that the conclusion of the Likert scale results in a “High” level, while the highest score is “Very High”. As for the octalysis test scale, the average score of 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 10. The conclusion from the results of this evaluation is that the motivation to learn e-learning during the Covid-19 period is quite high and has the potential to be developed. While the results of the Octalysis framework with 8 core drives are still average, for that we need innovation in E-learning which aims to increase student motivation based on Octalysis’s 8 core drives. The results of this study recommend that gamification is needed to increase student learning motivation in order to improve learning outcomes. © 2020.

However, only a few studies have investigated instructors’ continued intention to reuse LMS. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that influence instructors’ intention to reuse an LMS in higher education institutes. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a mixed-method research design. In the quantitative section, an integrated model of technology acceptance model and information system success model is proposed to explore the effects of system quality, service quality, information quality, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness on instructors’ satisfaction and how their satisfaction will influence their intention to reuse Google Classroom in the future. In the qualitative section, to gain more understanding, instructors were asked to identify the challenges that inhibit the adoption of e-Learning technologies in public universities in Iraq and what are their recommendations to rectify them. Findings: The findings revealed that service quality had no positive influences on the satisfaction of instructors, while other factors had varying levels of influence, the findings further showed that inadequate internet service and students lack of interest are the biggest challenges instructors faced during their experience with Google Classroom. Research limitations/implications: To improve the generalizability of the results, future studies are recommended to include larger samples, in addition, further studies are also advised to take individual traits such as age and gender into consideration. Originality/value: The outcomes of this study are expected to benefit researchers, policymakers and LMS developers who are interested in factors that affect instructors’ intention to reuse LMS in higher education institutes in developing countries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Distance learning; E-Learning; Google classroom; Higher education; Information systems; Learning management system; Technology acceptance",

Design/methodology/approach: A bilingual questionnaire in English and Vietnamese was delivered. It was pre-tested on 30 participants before it was finalized. The authors first reviewed the measurement model and made adjustments to the theoretical TAM model. Then the adjusted TAM was used to investigate the relationships of the constructs in the model. Findings: The results of the structural model show that computer self-efficacy (CSE) has a positive impact on perceived ease of use (PEOU). There is also a positive relationship between system interactivity (SI) and PEOU. Surprisingly, the authors documented that PEOU has no significant impact on students’ attitudes (ATT). The results show that SI can moderately affect ATT. Finally, it is noted that the social factor (SF) directly affects the student’s attitudes (ATT). Research/limitations/implications: This study contains three limitations. First, as this study only focuses on undergraduate programs, readers should be careful in applying the findings and/or implications of this study to other education levels such as K-12, vocational training and postgraduate programs. Second, the findings are generated within the context of one type of e-learning, conducted via Google Meet. Therefore, future research is needed to provide further validation and comparison across other forms of e-learning. Finally, to further prevent the common bias problem, future research should use both five-point and seven-point Likert scales for the response options in the survey, as well as use negatively worded items. This will help prevent respondents from providing similar answers to all questions. Originality/value: This study has both theoretical and practical implications. From a theoretical perspective, the study can provide a solid framework for similar studies. From a practical perspective, this study offers implications for governments and universities in the process of adopting e-learning, given that the Covid-19 pandemic is currently in its second and more dangerous wave. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Covid-19; E-Learning; Learning during emergency; Online teaching and learning; School closures; Technology acceptance model (TAM); Universities",

Due to fear of infection, government and local authorities in China immediately closed academic institutions and tried to find survival techniques to cope with market turbulence. COVID-19 was present in China at the end of 2019. However, little attention has been paid by researchers to coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, and few measures were taken to assess the coping strategies of university students, specifically following the closure of their institutions. To address this gap, this study attempted to discover the coping strategies of Chinese students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: We conducted an online survey using a semi-structured questionnaire with a simple random sampling technique and received 559 responses. The survey questions captured information about students' lives during the COVID-19 outbreak, actions to control anxiety, and what students care about during the pandemic. The associations between coping strategies used and levels of anxiety were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures. SPSS Statistics v27 was used for statistical analysis in this study. Results: The university students reported that coping strategies and survival techniques were required due to high levels of anxiety and psychological pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the respondents reported the prompt closure of their academic institutions due to COVID-19. Psychological concerns, such as lack of sleep, emotional support, mental support and social appeal, were also reported. Conclusions: This is one of the very first studies on coping strategies for anxiety in China. The study reveals that university students employ a number of coping strategies in relation to COVID-19, but also suggests a need to strengthen such strategies in this population. However, the study was limited to a small number of provinces in China, which may affect the generalizability of the research. © 2020 Nurunnabi M et al.","China; Coping strategy; Corona virus diseases; COVID-19; Students; University","adult; anxiety; Article; avoidance behavior; Chinese; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; mental stress; pandemic; sleep deprivation; social support; university student; young adult; adolescent; anxiety; China; epidemiology; psychology; student; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; China; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Students; Young Adult"

Academicians, students, and support staff are all working to accommodate this massive change. A survey research on the student, lecturer, and institutional readiness for online learning can help institutions better understand pre-COVID-19 perspectives. This study focuses on a case of Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) online education. This paper summary is one of a series of reports outlining higher education's readiness to move teaching and learning online to preserve and continue its educational mission during the current pandemic. Thus, questionnaire is distributed to all lecturers in UUM. The collected data is measured by Likert Scale of 1 to 5 and analyzed using IBM SPSS® software. The overall result has shown that lecturers in UUM are ready for online teaching during the lockdown period. However, there are several issues need to be rectified by the management of the university in preparing lecturer to convert their teaching and learning to online learning. As such, more training is required by the lecturer especially related to technological and online learning tools. Additionally, a reliable online learning platform is a must for the lecturer to endeavor this new experience. © 2020, Ankara University.

The virus is widely disseminated to almost every continent with over twenty-seven million infections and over ninety-thousand reported deaths attributed to COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded RNA virus, comprising three main viral proteins; membrane, spike and envelope. The clinical features of COVID‐19 disease can be classified according to different degrees of severity, with some patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can be fatal. In addition, many infections are asymptomatic or only cause mild symptoms. As there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 there is considerable endeavour to raise a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, in addition to engineering neutralizing antibody interventions. In the absence of an effective vaccine, movement controls of varying stringencies have been imposed. Whilst enforced lockdown measures have been effective, they may be less effective against the current strain of SARS-CoV-2, the G614 clade. Conversely, other mutations of the virus, such as the Δ382 variant could reduce the clinical relevance of infection. The front runners in the race to develop an effective vaccine focus on the SARS-Co-V-2 Spike protein. However, vaccines that produce a T-cell response to a wider range of SARS-Co-V-2 viral proteins, may be more effective. Population based studies that determine the level of innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2, from prior exposure to the virus or to other coronaviruses, will have important implications for government imposed movement control and the strategic delivery of vaccination programmes. © 2020 British Journal of Biomedical Science.","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","ad5 ncov; bnt 162 01; chadox1 ncov 19; chloroquine; favipiravir; gam-covid-vac; gx 19; hydroxychloroquine; inactivated vaccine; lopinavir; mrna 1273; mRNA-1273 vaccine; recombinant vaccine; reluscovtogene ralaplasmid; remdesivir; ritonavir; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; scb 2019; virus vaccine; acute kidney failure; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial ventilation; clinical feature; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cytokine storm; disease course; dyspnea; ethnicity; government; heart injury; human; immunity; immunotherapy; influenza vaccination; intensive care unit; lung fibrosis; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; plasma transfusion; prevalence; priority journal; Review; secondary infection; septic shock; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distancing; virus morphology; virus strain; virus transmission; drug therapy; immunology; pandemic; pathogenicity; prevention and control; virology; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Viral Vaccines"

As an initiative, the Malaysia government has call for the Movement Control Order (MCO) as one of the lockdown alternatives starting on 18th March 2020. Due to that, the MCO has given a huge impact on Malaysia’s industries including the construction industry. Hence, to successfully deliver projects, time and cost become the essential component which in this current scenario, most of the on-going projects declined to deliver the project according to the time and cost as planned. Thus, this paper intends to explore the consequences of the Movement Control Order (MCO) towards project success. In getting an authentic data and fast feedback from the respondents during this current scenario, uses alternate methods as face to face interview is not encouraged. The interview sessions were held thru telephone conversation with 8 contractors in Klang Valley and Penang which randomly selected based on contractor listing in Malaysian Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) website and content analysis are used to figure out the main consequences using Nvivo software. Results from the interviews found that the MCO has resulted in 6 main impacts consists of (1) regulation compliance; (2) safety; (3) additional time for project delivery; (4) increase in development cost; (5) limited human resources supplies; and (6) limited resource availability on-site. These shows the MCO has given the negative impact to the project success. This result is important for the government to ensure their awareness on the consequences of the MCO towards construction industry and facilitate the construction players to overcome the six factors mentioned in this paper. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

The timely diagnosis of infected patients is a critical step to limit the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The chest radiography imaging has shown to be an effective screening technique in diagnosing the COVID-19 epidemic. To reduce the pressure on radiologists and control of the epidemic, fast and accurate a hybrid deep learning framework for diagnosing COVID-19 virus in chest X-ray images is developed and termed as the COVID-CheXNet system. First, the contrast of the X-ray image was enhanced and the noise level was reduced using the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization and Butterworth bandpass filter, respectively. This was followed by fusing the results obtained from two different pre-trained deep learning models based on the incorporation of a ResNet34 and high-resolution network model trained using a large-scale dataset. Herein, the parallel architecture was considered, which provides radiologists with a high degree of confidence to discriminate between the healthy and COVID-19 infected people. The proposed COVID-CheXNet system has managed to correctly and accurately diagnose the COVID-19 patients with a detection accuracy rate of 99.99%, sensitivity of 99.98%, specificity of 100%, precision of 100%, F1-score of 99.99%, MSE of 0.011%, and RMSE of 0.012% using the weighted sum rule at the score-level. The efficiency and usefulness of the proposed COVID-CheXNet system are established along with the possibility of using it in real clinical centers for fast diagnosis and treatment supplement, with less than 2 s per image to get the prediction result. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chest radiography imaging; Chest X-ray images; Coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic; Deep learning; ResNet34 model; Transfer learning","Bandpass filters; Butterworth filters; Diagnosis; Disease control; Image enhancement; Large dataset; Learning systems; Parallel architectures; Viruses; X ray radiography; Adaptive histogram equalization; Chest radiography; Degree of confidence; Detection accuracy; Infected patients; Large-scale dataset; Learning frameworks; Screening techniques; Deep learning"

Medical students are more susceptible to be infected by the virus. This study aimed to assess COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude towards COVID-19, and preventive behaviours against COVID-19 among medical students within the first month of the onset of the outbreak in Malaysia. We collect data from medical students using an online Google survey form. Out of 696 students, 467 responded to the questionnaire. The analysis revealed that the mean percentage of knowledge was (85.04), attitude (84.12), and preventive practice (77.75) respectively. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis revealed that living with family (p<0.01) and knowledge of COVID-19 (p<0.001) appeared to be important predictors of attitude toward COVID-19. However, gender (p<0.001), living status (p<0.001), frequency of travel during movement control order (p<0.01), attitude towards COVID-19 (p<0.001) have appeared significant predictors for preventive practice against COVID-19. But knowledge of COVID-19 had no impact on preventive practice against COVID-19 (p>0.05). We found a high level of COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice against COVID-19 among medical students. A sustained knowledge, attitude, and preventive behavioural strategy could play an ingredient in upholding the student’s learning and practice against any disease like COVID-19. © 2020","attitude; COVID-19; knowledge; practice; Sarawak",

This paper aims to identify behavioral and demographic predictors of handwashing. The study surveyed 674 adults in Malaysia in May 2020. Time spent on social media predicted handwashing contingent on gender and number of children. More time spent on social media was positively associated with handwashing for males with three or more children. However, for males without children, social media use was negatively associated with handwashing. The association was not significant for males with one or two children. For females, more time spent on social media was significantly linked to more handwashing only for females with one child. Gender, a traditional predictor of handwashing, was a useful predictor only for those who spend more than three hours per day on social media and had at most one child. Number of children was a novel negative predictor for males who did not use social media and who averaged one hour per day on social media, a positive predictor for males who spent lots of time on social media, but not a predictor for females. In sum, social media use predicts handwashing, and is thus a helpful variable for use in targeted health communication during a pandemic - particularly through social media. Further, more conventional predictors like gender and number of children exhibit contingency effects with social media use and must thus be jointly considered with it. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We aimed to investigate the barriers to the physical prevention, negative attitudes, and anxiety levels. Methods: A online cross-sectional survey was conducted with the people living in Wuhan between March 12th and 23rd, 2020. Results: Of a total of 2411 complete responses, the mean and standard deviation for the total physical prevention barriers score was 19.73 (standard deviation ± 5.3; range 12−45) out of a possible score of 48. Using a cut-off score of 44 for the State-Trait Inventory score, 79.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.2−81.5) of the participants reported moderate to severe anxiety during the early phase of the outbreak, and 51.3% (95% CI 49.2−53.3) reported moderate to severe anxiety after the peak of coronavirus diseases 2019 was over (during the study period). Comparing anxiety levels in the early phase of the outbreak and after the peak of the outbreak, 58.5% (95% CI 56.5−60.5) recorded a decreased anxiety. Females reported a higher likelihood of having decreased levels of anxiety than males (odds ratio = 1.78, 95% CI 1.48−2.14). Low negative attitudes score were associated with a higher decrease in anxiety (odds ratio = 1.59, 95% CI 1.33−1.89).

In response, some Muslim communities have launched fundraising campaigns to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the virus on the front-liners and the most affected segments of vulnerable populations. The purpose of this study is to explore the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of donors to these campaigns who contribute via social media platforms (SMPs). Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a cross-sectional research design using an online survey conducted in a typical Muslim community such as Kuwait. A total of 565 samples of data (356 women, 209 men) were used for analysis. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling was used to estimate the research model and extract meaningful conclusions. Findings: The results show that charitable projects, internet technology features, SMP features and religiosity are significant motivations that influence attitudes toward online donations related to COVID-19 response. All these relationships are indirectly related to intentions to donate via SMP through a significant mediating effect of attitude. Practical implications: The outcome of this study could support the efforts of governments, non-profit organizations and communities to focus attention on suitable proactive strategies to boost online fundraising campaigns for those affected by epidemic diseases. Originality/value: This study enriches the literature by integrating both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of online donations into a new and unique related context such as SMP, especially amid the COVID-19 crisis. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19 epidemic; Fundraising campaigns; Islamic marketing; Social media platforms; Socio-economic impacts",

Nevertheless, the highly contagious virus has instigated an unimaginably rapid response from scientific and medical communities. Objectives: Pioneering research on molecular mechanisms underlying the viral transmission, molecular pathogenicity, and potential treatments will be highlighted in this review. The development of antiviral drugs specific to SARS-CoV-2 is a complicated and tedious process. To accelerate scientific discoveries and advancement, researchers are consolidating available data from associated coronaviruses into a single pipeline, which can be readily made available to vaccine developers. Methods: In order to find studies evaluating the COVID-19 virus epidemiology, repurposed drugs and potential vaccines, web searches and bibliographical bases have been used with keywords that matches the content of this review. Results: The published results of SARS-CoV-2 structures and interactomics have been used to identify potential therapeutic candidates. We illustrate recent publications on SARS-CoV-2, concerning its molecular, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics, and focus on innovative diagnostics technologies in the production pipeline. This objective of this review is to enhance the comprehension of the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and strengthen future control measures. Lay Summary: An innovative analysis is evaluating the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim is to increase knowledge of possible viral detection methods, which highlights several new technology limitations and advantages. We have assessed some drugs currently for patients (Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Anakinra and Interferon beta 1a), as the feasibility of COVID-19 specific antivirals is not presently known. The study explores the race toward vaccine development and highlights some significant trials and candidates in various clinical phases. This research addresses critical knowledge gaps by identifying repurposed drugs currently under clinical trials. Findings will be fed back rapidly to the researchers interested in COVID 19 and support the evidence and potential of possible therapeutics and small molecules with their mode of action. © 2020, Bentham Science Publishers.

The investigations of binding properties in disease-related proteins derived from the comparison of amino acid substructure arrangements allows for effective mechanism driven decision making to rank and select only the compounds with the highest potential for success and safety to be prioritized for clinical trials or treatments. The intention of this work is not to explicitly identify candidate compounds but to present how an integrated drug repositioning and potential toxicity pipeline using side chain similarity searching algorithms are of great utility in epidemic scenarios involving novel pathogens. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we demonstrate that the pipeline can identify candidate compounds quickly and sustainably in combination with associated risk factors derived from the analysis of potential off-target site binding by the compounds to be repurposed. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Drug repositioning; Off-target sites; SARS-CoV-2; Side chain similarity","Amino acids; Binding energy; Decision making; Diseases; Pipelines; Proteins; Risk assessment; Toxicity; Viruses; Binding properties; Drug binding sites; Drug repositioning; Drug-target interactions; Effective mechanisms; Protein structures; Similarity Searching; Toxicity assessment; Binding sites; acetylsalicylic acid; adenosine diphosphate ribose; amprenavir; chloroquine; colchicine; coronavirus nucleocapsid protein; coronavirus protein; darunavir; drug; folic acid; indometacin; lenalidomide; lopinavir; losartan; mepacrine; methotrexate; naproxen; nonstructural protein 10; nonstructural protein 15; nonstructural protein 16; nonstructural protein 7; nonstructural protein 8; pomalidomide; prostaglandin E synthase; ritonavir; sildenafil; thalidomide; unclassified drug; vardenafil; viral nonstructural protein; virus spike protein; antiviral activity; Article; binding affinity; bleeding; clinical outcome; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; drug binding site; drug repositioning; drug structure; epidemic; erectile dysfunction; eye toxicity; folic acid deficiency; hemophilia; human; integrated health care system; ligand binding; lipodystrophy; lupus erythematosus; malaria; molecular docking; multiple myeloma; nerve degeneration; neurological complication; off-target effect; pharmacophore; priority journal; protein structure; rheumatoid arthritis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; side effect; software; toxicity assay"

However, a full understanding of consumer preferences and purchasing decisions of products and services remains untouched till date Therefore, this study aimed to address consumer purchase intentions of organic food in the ‘new normal’ practice, wherein a total of 320 valid surveys were received for further analysis. It was conducted in Malaysia using an online questionnaire approach due to the current social distancing practices and concerns. The finding subsequently revealed that food safety knowledge influenced the elements of personal attitude, perceived social pressure, perceived autonomy, and perceived green trust embedded in study respondents. Meanwhile, personal attitude, perceived social pressure, and perceived autonomy were specifically found to correspondingly impact customer purchase intention of organic food. However, perceived green trust did not mediate the relationship between personal attitude, perceived social pressure, and perceived autonomy with organic food purchase intention during the pandemic and ‘new normal’ life. Accordingly, the study is notably useful for market players in understanding the ‘new normal’ of one’s life post-COVID-19. Thus, it is hoped that much more efforts to disseminate knowledge on food safety among consumers will be encouraged in promoting consumer’s purchase intention of organic food, besides opening up more opportunities for related research to be conducted in the future. © 2020, Malaysian Consumer and Family Economics Association.

Respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality in the elderly population with pre-existing medical conditions. This group is particularly vulnerable to infections due to a declined immune system, comorbidities, geriatric syndrome, and potentially inappropriate polypharmacy. These conditions make the elderly population more susceptible to the harmful effects of medications and the deleterious consequences of infections, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Chronic diseases among elderlies, including respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart diseases, present a significant challenge for healthcare professionals. To comply with the clinical guidelines, the practitioner may prescribe a complex medication regimen that adds up to the burden of pre-existing treatment, potentially inducing adverse drug reactions and leading to harmful side-effects. Consequently, the geriatric population is at increased risk of falls, frailty, and dependence that enhances their susceptibility to morbidity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 respiratory syndrome, particularly interstitial pneumonia. The major challenge resides in the detection of infection that may present as atypical manifestations in this age group. Healthy aging can be possible with adequate preventive measures and appropriate medication regimen and follow-up. Adherence to the guidelines and recommendations of WHO, CDC, and other national/regional/international agencies can reduce the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Better training programs are needed to enhance the skill of health care professionals and patient’s caregivers.

The probability of these seaports catering the same client is very high and may cause overlapping in the hinterland area. This will further result in the waste of resources, congestion in traffic and reducing the competitiveness of seaports. The situation worsened during Covid-19 outbreak as these two seaports faced issues related to capacity and efficiency. This paper employs geoeconomics concept to assist these seaports to design a post Covid-19 recovery plan for these seaports via temporal, spatial and policy taxonomies. An explanatory sequential mixed method design has been employed to meet aims of the paper. The results show that hinterlands in the Southern region are important as production centres, providing logistics efficiency and improving the connectivity. Given the importance of service recovery to continue patronage of these seaports among customers, revitalising 4th industrial revolution and materialising inland capacity are additional post Covid-19 recovery strategies for improved seaport performance from a policy and spatial taxonomies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,

Among others, the hospitality industry is significantly and negatively influenced by this pandemic. Given the unique characteristics of services, using advanced technology is not enough to create a memorable experience without physical interaction between service providers and customers. Thus, this study aims to define the “new normal” for service customers and to explore the “new service design” for the hotel industry. Design/methodology/approach: As most of the Southeast Asian countries heavily rely on the tourism industry, this study focuses on one of the emerging tourism destinations in this region, Malaysia. The data is collected through in-depth interviews with 17 potential national and international tourists. Findings: The results suggest that considering the “new normal” for customers, there is an immediate need for the hotel industry to revamp their service design by mainly practicing disinfection and sanitation activities, re-designing overall infrastructure and introducing promotional offers. Originality/value: This study is novel in its kind as it provides useful guidelines for both practitioners and academicians/researchers. Under this crucial time, very few research is conducted specifically focusing on the hotel industry and tourists’ behaviors amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

These experiences of insecurity have been heightened in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we examine the collective experience of insecurity among migrant workers in Malaysia. In our analysis, we outline collective insecurity at two levels: the micro level of migrant workers- daily, subjective experiences of insecurity; and the macro level, in which insecurity is a consequence of structural forces, specifically the globalisation of labour. These two levels interact symbiotically, producing states of insecurity that are concretely experienced as anxiety and fear. Migrant workers in Malaysia also practice agency through small forms of resistance that they use to bolster one another and reduce their insecure experiences. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia, migrant workers have been further marginalised by the state, but they have also become connected to one another through acts of solidarity and resistance. However, the sustainability of these forms remains unclear. © 2020 MIGRATION LETTERS Transnational Press London","Collective insecurity; COVID-19; Malaysia; Migrant workers; Migration; Virtual resistance",

Hence, the discussion may be useful for all the stakeholders (government, policymakers and the public) for their reference. Various studies previously observed that widespread contagious diseases have a severe impact on the economy. It is observed that the faster and wider the outbreak of disease, the higher and severer the influence on the economies. The economies face shrinkage of income, revenue, earnings, while health expenditure increases for hospitals, medical kits, ventilators, uniforms, masks, gloves, medicines and other medical equipment. Therefore, it has a two-pronged adversely hitting effect on economies to manage the imbalance in the budget and fiscal matters.

Due to the large number of people affected by this pandemic, the medical and healthcare departments are facing a delay in the detection of COVID-19. Besides, it is not an easy task to clarify the images from the radiograph on what types of infection between bacteria pneumonia and COVID-19. The automatic feature analysis can help physicians more precisely in the treatment and diagnosis of diseases. In this research, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture features algorithm has been proposed to automate the current manual approach. This process starts by extracting the intensity grayscale texture from the normal, bacteria pneumonia and COVID-19 chest x-ray images. To prove the accuracy of LBP, a simple classifier k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) has been implement to classify the chest x-ray images into normal, bacterial and pneumonia class. The 10-fold cross validation has been used to validate the chest x-ray images. From the evaluation, 96% accuracy can be achieved by using LBP as a feature extraction feature. It shows that LBP is a powerful texture features to detect COVID-19 from the x-ray images.

Africa was projected to be devastated by COVID-19. There is currently limited data regarding regional predictors of mortality among patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the independent risk factors associated with mortality among patients with COVID-19 in Africa. Methods: A total of 1028 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Africa with definite survival outcomes were identified retrospectively from an open-access individual-level worldwide COVID-19 database. The live version of the dataset is available at https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine the risk factors that independently predict mortality among patients with COVID-19 in Africa. Results: Of the 1028 cases included in study, 432 (42.0%) were females with a median (interquartile range, IQR) age of 50 (24) years. Older age (adjusted odds ratio {aOR} 1.06; [95% confidence intervals {95% CI}, 1.04–1.08]), presence of chronic disease (aOR 9.63; [95% CI, 3.84–24.15]), travel history (aOR 2.44; [95% CI, 1.26–4.72]), as well as locations of Central Africa (aOR 0.14; [95% CI, 0.03–0.72]) and West Africa (aOR 0.12; [95% CI, 0.04–0.32]) were identified as the independent risk factors significantly associated with increased mortality among the patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving gradually in Africa. Among patients with COVID-19 in Africa, older age, presence of chronic disease, travel history, and the locations of Central Africa and West Africa were associated with increased mortality. A regional response should prioritize strategies that will protect these populations.

This study aims to observe empirically the effect of healthcare expenditure and heath sectors growth on CO2 during Covid 19 outbreak in Malaysia. As the world has awakened to the potential risks of Covid 19, there has been a massive effort to add capacity to the healthcare system rapidly. In Malaysia, apart from stressing the need for the public to strictly adhere to the Movement Control Order (MCO), the government an immediate boost in funding for healthcare services through initial stage fiscal policy response to Covid 19 outbreak. This research used Dynamic Panel Data Model also known as longitudinal study. This study explained Dynamic Panel Data System GMM Estimation model is fitting to interpret the outcome, indicate healthcare expenditure and healthcare growth on Covid-19, inflation rate and unemployment rate have significant relationship with CO2 emission. Empirical findings suggest that CO2 emissions policies reforms are required to channelize healthcare sector growth to a more government spending resulting from fiscal policy designed by the government of Malaysia. The regulators of other countries should pull out CO2 emissions policies to achieve sustainable economic growth and health sector growth development. The results provide important information to allow comparisons of the health-care sector with other economic sectors in Malaysia and the global healthcare sector in terms of CO2 emission.

We aimed to share our strategy in handling neurosurgical emergencies at a remote center in Borneo island. Our objectives included discussing the logistic and geographic challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Miri General Hospital is a remote center in Sarawak, Malaysia, serving a population with difficult access to neurosurgical services. Two neurosurgeons were stationed here on a rotational basis every fortnight during the pandemic to handle neurosurgical cases. Patients were triaged depending on their urgent needs for surgery or transfer to a neurosurgical center and managed accordingly. All patients were screened for potential risk of contracting COVID-19 prior to the surgery. Based on this, the level of personal protective equipment required for the health care workers involved was determined. Results: During the initial 6 weeks of the Movement Control Order in Malaysia, there were 50 urgent neurosurgical consultations. Twenty patients (40%) required emergency surgery or intervention. There were 9 vascular (45%), 5 trauma (25%), 4 tumor (20%), and 2 hydrocephalus cases (10%). Eighteen patients were operated at Miri General Hospital, among whom 17 (94.4%) survived. Ninety percent of anticipated transfers were avoided. None of the medical staff acquired COVID-19.

However, some have debated that it could be airborne. Airborne transmission occurs when particles of less than 0.5 μm within droplets spread through exhaled air via a process called aerosolisation. These particles can remain in the air for long periods and can disseminate over distances further than 1 meter. In the context of COVID-19, airborne particles can occur during certain aerosolised-generating-procedures (AGP). WHO underlines the use of N95 respirators or equivalent as part of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers (HCW) managing COVID-19 positive patients when aerosolised-generating-procedures (AGP) are being conducted.This retrospective observational study describes the result of COVID-19 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in health care workers (HCW) wearing different form of personal protective equipment (PPE) who had had close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient during performing such procedures. All HCWs were quarantined for 14 days after the exposure. COVID-19 RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs were performed at different intervals. Little is known about the effectiveness of different types of personal protective equipment (PPE) for preventing SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs. We describe the clinical outcome of HCWs exposed to sudden acute respiratory infection patient before the diagnosis of COVID-19 was known. © The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America 2020.",,

In addition to providing a source of data for analysis, this discourse has also led to a rethinking of multifarious research methods. This section presents a series of articles by scholars from different parts of the world with macro- and micro-linguistic perspectives, ranging from corpus-based analysis to content analysis studies. At the macro level, these scholars explored ways through which government bodies communicate with the public. Official announcements, parliamentary proceedings and COVID-19-related corpora are examined and a comparative textual analysis between the Malaysian and British governments is provided. At the micro level, the scholars analysed selected corpora with lexical, semantic, and discourse foci and personal posts of short narratives and photos to encapsulate meanings from human life and experience. The main takeaway from these studies is the application of a wide range of methods for different focus and perspectives that may be customised to the researcher’s unique context. © 2020 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Thus, health agencies have recommended the use of facemasks as a protective measure. The current study investigated the prevalence and factors contributing to incorrect facemask use among individuals visiting high risk public locations. A cross-sectional observational study of facemask use among individuals visiting high risk public facilities was conducted during a local COVID-19 outbreak from end of April to middle of May 2020 in Sitiawan, Perak, Malaysia. Enrolment in the study included any individuals entering the selected study facilities via a dedicated entry point. Suitable study locations were identified as a local wet market selling freshly slaughtered animals and a district specialist hospital.Trained data collectors were stationed at the entry points to observe individuals entering the selected facilities for the type, category, and correct facemask use. Individuals were categorized into two groups, correct and incorrect facemask users, based on visual observation of facemask use. The Pearson chi-square test was used for differences in investigated variables. Both binary and multiple logistic regression models were used in this study. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board. The main outcome measure was facemask use (either correct or incorrect).A total of 3322 individuals with a high prevalence of facemask use (98.2%) consisting of a large proportion of medical-grade face masks (75.5%) were included in this study. Male individuals, Malay ethnic people, high-risk age groups, and those wearing a medical grade facemask were more likely to present incorrect facemask use. A high prevalence of facemask use among individuals visiting public facilities was observed. However, incorrect facemask use raises the need for of targeted public health strategy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 epidemic. © 2020, Mahidol University - ASEAN Institute for Health Development.

It examines the readiness of USIM's final year students to the internship during the lockdown period, the readiness to join GE programs and also employment prospects in the future. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey was employed, and 1,445 USIM final year students participated in this study. Findings: The findings reveal that USIM final year students are ready to perform their internship even during the lockdown period. Besides, the students are also ready to join GE programs conducted by USIM, even while COVID-19 pandemic still currently occurs. Meanwhile, for the employment prospects in the future, results show that they believed that the employment prospects in the future after COVID-19 is low. In addition, academic background and internship areas exacerbate COVID-19's impact on the perceptions of USIM final year students on the employment prospects in the future. Originality/value: This study is believed to be a pioneering study in identifying the impact of COVID-19 on the GE.

We undertook an online survey to measure the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in Indonesia. The WTP was assessed using a simple dichotomous contingent valuation approach and a linear regression model was used to assess its associated determinants. There were 1,359 respondents who completed the survey. In total, 78.3% (1,065) were willing to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine with a mean and median WTP of US$ 57.20 (95%CI: US$ 54.56, US$ 59.85) and US$ 30.94 (95%CI: US$ 30.94, US$ 30.94), respectively. Being a health-care worker, having a high income, and having high perceived risk were associated with higher WTP. These findings suggest that the WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high in Indonesia. This WTP information can be used to construct a payment model for a COVID-19 vaccine in the country. Nevertheless, to attain higher vaccine coverage, it may be necessary to partially subsidize the vaccine for those who are less wealthy and to design health promotion materials to increase the perceived risk for COVID-19 in the country. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","COVID-19; indonesia; SARS-CoV-2; vaccination; vaccine; willingness-to-pay","vaccine; adult; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; education; female; health care access; health care survey; health promotion; household income; human; Indonesia; job satisfaction; major clinical study; male; medical staff; middle aged; questionnaire; vaccination; Willingness To Pay; administration and dosage; adolescent; economics; epidemiology; health care cost; health care personnel; patient attitude; prevention and control; psychology; questionnaire; vaccination; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Expenditures; Health Personnel; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination; Young Adult"

Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out at 10 different dental hospitals in Pakistan from March to June 2020. A 35 items valid and reliable questionnaire was used to assess the concerns, perceived impact, and preparedness of oral healthcare workers (OHCW) in COVID-19 pandemic. Chi-squared test and logistic regression were used for analysis. Results: A total of 583 OHCW participated in this study. The odds of having the awareness about the risk of exposure and fear of getting infected, were greater in the clinical than non-clinical OHCW (OR: 52.6; OR: 15.9). For social network concerns, the clinical OHCW were more likely to be concerned about their colleagues (OR: 6.0). The clinical OHCW have greater odds of worrying about telling the family/friends about the risk exposed to (OR: 2.55), being avoided because of the job (OR: 3.20) and more likely to be feeling stressed (OR: 4.31). Less than 50% of the participants felt that their institutions are well prepared and only 12.6% had attended an infection control training session. Most participants practiced self-preparation such as buying masks and disinfection (94.3%, 98.3%). Conclusion: The majority of OHCW felt concerned about their risk of exposure to infection and falling ill from exposure and infecting friends/family. There is a need for training of infection control and PPE and minimizing fear and psychological impact on OHCW should be the priority in any preparedness and planning for combating COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

The spread started at the end of January 2020, and different countries used different approaches in terms of testing, sanitization, lock down and quarantine centres to control the spread of the virus. People are getting back to working and routine life activities with new normal standards of testing, sanitization, social distancing and lock down. People are regularly tested to identify those who are infected with COVID-19 and isolate them from general public. However, testing all people unnecessarily is an expensive operation in terms of resources usage. There must be an optimal policy to test only those who have higher chances of being COVID-19 positive. Similarly, sanitization is used for individuals and streets to disinfect people and places. However, sanitization is also an expensive operation in terms of resources, and it is not possible to disinfect each and every individual and street. Social separating or lock down or quarantine centres focuses are different methodologies that are utilised to control the human-to-human transmission of the infection and separate the individuals who are contaminated with COVID-19. However, lock down and quarantine centres are expensive operations in terms of resources as it disturbs the affairs of state and the growth of economy. At the same time, it negatively affects the quality of life of a society. It is also not possible to provide resources to all citizens by locking them inside homes or quarantine centres for infinite time. All these parameters are expensive in terms of resources and have an effect on controlling the spread of the virus, quality of life of human, resources and economy. In this article, a novel intelligent method based on reinforcement learning (RL) is built up that quantifies the unique levels of testing, disinfection and lock down alongside its impact on the spread of the infection, personal satisfaction or quality of life, resource use and economy. Different RL algorithms are actualized and agents are prepared with these algorithms to interact with the environment to gain proficiency with the best strategy. The examinations exhibit that deep learning–based algorithms, for example, DQN and DDPG are performing better than customary RL algorithms, for example, Q-Learning and SARSA. © The Author(s) 2020.","COVID-19 prevention; policy learning; Reinforcement learning","Deep learning; Locks (fasteners); Quality control; Transmissions; Viruses; General publics; Human-to-human transmission; Infinite time; Intelligent method; Optimal policies; Quality of life; Resource use; Sanitization; Reinforcement learning"

To this end, in the present study, based on a recent heuristic algorithm proposed by the authors, the time evolution of COVID-19 is investigated for six different countries/states, namely New York, California, USA, Iran, Sweden and UK. The number of COVID-19-related deaths is used to develop the proposed heuristic model as it is believed that the predicted number of daily deaths in each country/state includes information about the quality of the health system in each area, the age distribution of population, geographical and environmental factors as well as other conditions. Based on derived predicted epidemic curves, a new 3D-epidemic surface is proposed to assess the epidemic phenomenon at any time of its evolution. This research highlights the potential of the proposed model as a tool which can assist in the risk assessment of the COVID-19.

COVID-19 reinforces the need to explore online learning and learning opportunities. However, the ability of teachers to recognize and see how individual students engage in online learning is more challenging. Student emotions such as self-esteem, inspiration, dedication, and others that are assumed to be determinants of student success cannot be overlooked. The main objective of this research is to evaluate the emotion of student on e-learning during COVID-19 pandemic using a facial recognition application. This application able to interpretation of facial expressions into extracted emotional states. An image processing approach has been implements in 4 types of emotion which is happy, normal, sad and surprise. Next the image will go through the identifying of emotion type from the static frontal face image. It starts with image acquisition, grayscale conversion and contrast stretching for image pre-processing, Haar Cascade or also known as Viola-Jones technique for face detection, face model technique for eye and mouth localization, skin-color segmentation technique for image segmentation, and Grey-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) for feature extraction. The classification for emotion type is using SVM Regression. The accuracy percentage of emotion classification is calculated. The result showed that SVM Regression has a high accuracy rate of 99.16%. A real-time application will be developed to identify human face emotion instead of static image for future work with additional of speech recognition exploration. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

By 10th April 2020, Malaysia reported more than 4,000 outbreak cases, the highest in Southeast Asia. Recently, a forecasting model was developed to measure and predict daily Covid-19 cases in Malaysia for the coming 10 days using previously-confirmed cases. A Singular Spectrum Analysis-based forecasting model that discriminates noise in a time series trend is introduced. The key concept of the proposed model, RF-SSA, is improving the efficiency of recurrent SSA by establishing L and r parameters via several tests. The RF-SSA model assessment is based on the World Health Organization’s official Covid-19 data to predict the daily confirmed cases after 10th April until 20th April, 2020. These results show that the parameter L= 4 (T/20) for RF-SSA model was suitable for short time series outbreak data and the appropriate number of eigentriples to obtain is important as it influences the forecasting result. Evidently, the RF-SSA has over-forecasted the cases by 0.36%. This indicates RF-SSA’s competence to predict the impending number of Covid-19 cases. Nevertheless, enhanced RF-SSA algorithm should to be developed for higher effectivity in capturing any extreme data changes. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Numerous ""chokepoints""exist in the ""Near""Seas (East China, South China, and Yellow Seas), some created by China, others by the Western Alliance. Many ""bottlenecks""exist across South Asia, especially involving land territory disputed by China, India and Pakistan. As a result, the BRI is laden with obstacles, not the least of which is its gargantuan expense to China and to host countries, particularly on the overland routes, exacerbated by COVID-19. International investment is required, as are competitive maritime and land routes to counter Chinese monopolies. This paper will chart some potential solutions designed to partner China's immense BRI effort with foreign investors: (1) an express highway plus high-speed rail line between Vladivostok Russia and Lódz Poland, and (2) a sea route across the Arctic Circle (""Northwest Passage""), facilitated by global warming. Capabilities exist already, such as with the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Upgraded infrastructure requires Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from Asia, Europe, and North America to balance Chinese influence, reduce debt and risk of financial collapse in developing countries. Chinese routes seem to have deliberately sidelined the Russian Federation that should be included to promote competition.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Persian version of the nurses’ intention to care scale (NICS) by Iranian nurses who care for patients with COVID-19 in hospitals. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on nurses (n= 400) at public and private Mazandaran hospitals. An online questionnaire was used that consisted of two parts: demo-graphic variables and NICS. The scale was translated into Persian first and then validated using both construct and content validity. Results: The findings from an exploratory factor analysis yielded six factors that explained 53.12% of the total variance of the NICS. The confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the model had a good fit and the inter-item correlation values of the factors indicated good internal consistency. Conclusion: The Persian version of NICS in Iranian nurses had six factors. The results of our study add insight for nurse administrators and educators to further develop strategies to increase nurses’ intention by improving positive attitudes and reducing their negative beliefs. © 2020 Rahmatpour et al.","COVID-19; Intention; Nursing care; Reliability; Theory of planned behavior; Validity","adult; Article; confirmatory factor analysis; construct validity; content validity; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; demography; exploratory factor analysis; female; hospital patient; human; internal consistency; Iranian people; male; nurse administrator; nurse attitude; Nurses Intention to Care Scale; online system; private hospital; psychometry; public hospital; questionnaire; rating scale; reliability; validity"

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic outbreak emerged in December 2019 from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and spread to the rest of the world. This disease was named COVID-19 by World Health Organization. To date (17th April 2020) a total of 2,230,439 cases of COVID-19; 150,810 cases of deaths and 564,210 recovered cases have been reported worldwide. In this review the SARS-CoV-2 morphology, pathogenic mechanism, similarities and differences between SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome, transmission mode, diagnosis, treatment, and preventive measures were investigated. The outbreak of COVID-19 from a Malaysian perspective was explored and mental health care during the COVID-19 outbreak was explored. To date, there is no vaccine or no specific treatment for COVID-19. Therefore, preventive measures are very important to prevent and control the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Government authorities in a growing number of countries are taking actions to encourage contactless payments as the COVID-19 pandemic escalates. People are worried that novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) can be transmitted through physical money. It drives them to shift to e-wallet. Due to a lack of study on this topic, the present study contributes to the literature by examining the effect of perceived risk, government support, and perceived usefulness on customers’ intention to use e-wallet during COVID-19 outbreak. To give more fruitful insight, another major contribution of this study is investigating the group difference between Indonesia and Malaysia in the overall model. Questionnaires are distributed to the respondents by using a proportional sampling technique. As a result, 259 total respondents from Indonesia and 207 from Malaysia are collected. Both countries are selected because Indonesia and Malaysia can be considered as the two-worst countries in ASEAN affected by COVID-19. The model is tested using PLS-Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. The results show that the effects of government support on the intention to use e-wallets differ between countries. Besides, perceived usefulness fully mediated government support-intention to use e-wallets relationship, and partially mediated the effect of perceived risk on intention to use e-wallets. © 2020 The Author(s).

Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; computer-aided diagnostic tool; COVID-19 pneumonia; machine learning; transfer learning; viral pneumonia","Computer aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Database systems; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Functional polymers; Polymerase chain reaction; Transfer learning; Automatic Detection; Classification accuracy; Computer aided diagnostics; Health care professionals; Learning techniques; Preventive measures; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Technological tools; Learning algorithms"

Patients infected with the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 are placed in quarantine, so the virus does not spread. The medical community has not discovered any vaccine that can be immediately used on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The only method discovered so far to protect people from this virus is keeping a distance from other people, wearing masks and gloves, as well as regularly washing and sanitizing hands. Government and law enforcement agencies are involved in banning the movement of people in different cities, to control the spread and monitor people following the guidelines of the CDC. But it is not possible for the government to monitor all places, such as shopping malls, hospitals, government offices, and banks, and guide people to follow the safety guidelines. In this paper, a novel technique is developed that can guide people to protect themselves from someone who has high exposure to the virus or has symptoms of COVID-19, such as having fever and coughing. Different deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models are implemented to test the proposed technique. The proposed intelligent monitoring system can be used as a complementary tool to be installed at different places and automatically monitor people adopting the safety guidelines. With these precautionary measurements, humans will be able to win this fight against COVID-19. © 2020 M.

For instance, most learning institutions have been forced to temporarily close and implement the Learning from Home system (LFH). According to UNESCO, 1.7 billion children from 191 countries felt the effects of this temporary shutdown. These institutions respond to this situation differently, depending on choices available to students, teachers, and parents, as well as material and human resources. Most policies use innovative digital and cellular technology combined with traditional technology, radio, and TV to offer continuous education. Depending on distance and technological facilities, such as internet and Wi-Fi, LFH increases the access gap in gaining a quality education. This article analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on the education system in Indonesia. It examines the opportunities and challenges presented by the pandemic in the education system technology. The pandemic seriously affects student learning and welfare. It widens the gap between fortunate and less fortunate students in accessing quality education. Furthermore, Indonesia has formulated several long-term policies related to ICT and education.

Decisions on how to apply non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing and travel restrictions should also be based on evidence. There are some experiential and mathematical modelling data for these interventions, but there is a lack of data on the social, ethical and behavioural aspects of these interventions in the literature. Therefore, our study aims to produce evidence to inform (non-pharmaceutical) interventions such as communications, quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, travel restrictions and other public health measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study will be conducted in the United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Thailand. We propose to conduct 600-1000 quantitative surveys and 25-35 qualitative interviews per country. Data collection will follow the following four themes: (1) Quarantine and self-isolation (2) social distancing and travel restrictions (3) wellbeing and mental health (4) information, misinformation and rumours. In light of limitations of travel and holding in-person meetings, we will primarily use online/remote methods for collecting data. Study participants will be adults who have provided informed consent from different demographic, socio-economic and risk groups. Discussion: At the time of the inception of the study, United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Thailand have initiated strict public health measures and varying degrees of 'lockdowns'; to curb the pandemic. These public health measures will change in the coming weeks and months depending on the number of cases of COVID-19 in the respective countries.

Patients with cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities are typically prescribed with long-term medications. We reviewed the management of co-medications prescribed for CVDs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Areas covered: There is no specific contraindication or caution related to COVID-19 on the use of antihypertensives unless patients develop hypotension from septic shock where all antihypertensives should be discontinued or severe hypokalemia in which continuation of RAS inhibitors is not desired. The continuation of antiplatelet and statin in case of adverse CV event should be based on risk-benefit assessment. Patients with atrial fibrillation receiving oral anticoagulants, particularly those who are critically ill, should be considered for substitution to parenteral anticoagulants. Expert opinion: An individualized approach to medication management among hospitalized patients with concurrent CVDs would seem prudent with attention paid to changes in clinical conditions and medications intended for COVID-19. The decision to change prescribed long-term medications should be entailed by close follow-up to check if a revision on the decision is needed, with resumption or a plan for resumption of any long-term medication before hospital discharge if it is discontinued during hospitalization for COVID-19, for continuity of care. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cardiovascular; COVID-19; drug-drug interaction; renin-angiotensin system; statin","anticoagulant agent; antihypertensive agent; adverse outcome; atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; disease severity; drug withdrawal; heart failure; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; hypertension; hypokalemia; hypotension; medication therapy management; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Review; septic shock; Betacoronavirus; cardiovascular disease; complication; Coronavirus infection; hospitalization; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; Anticoagulants; Antihypertensive Agents; Betacoronavirus; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Hospitalization; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral"

Methods: Orthopaedic surgeons nationwide were invited through email and text messages to answer an online self-administered questionnaire collecting demographic information, COVID-19 exposure experience, perception of risk, and impact on orthopaedic practice. Results: Of the respondents, 4.7% and 14.0% were involved in frontline treatment for COVID-19 patients with non-orthopaedic and orthopaedic problem, respectively. Respondents working in Ministry of Health had highest percentage of involvement as frontliner, 7.8% (8/103) and 20.4% (21/103) for non-orthopaedic and orthopaedic related COVID-19 treatment, respectively (not significant). Their main concern was an infection of family members (125/235, 53.2%). Majority of respondents were still working (223/235, 94.9%), running outpatient clinics (168/223, 75.3%), and continued with their semi-emergency (190/223, 85.2%) and emergency surgeries (213/223, 95.5%). Of the surgeons, 11.2% (25/223) did not screen their patients for COVID-19 prior to elective surgeries, 30.9% (69/223) did not have any training on proper handling of personal protective equipment (PPE), 84.8% (189/223) make decision to manage more conservatively due to COVID-19 and 61.9% (138/223) had their income affected. Of the surgeons, 19.3% (43/223) started using telehealth facilities. Conclusion: Direct exposure to treatment of COVID-19 patients among the respondent is low and the main concern was infecting their family member. There are still several surgeons who did not conduct preoperative COVID-19 screening and practice without proper PPE training. © The Author(s) 2020.","COVID-19; orthopaedic surgeons; pandemics; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; surveys and questionnaires","adult; aged; Article; clinical practice; conservative treatment; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; elective surgery; emergency surgery; female; health survey; human; income; infection risk; Malaysia; male; medical decision making; orthopedics; outpatient; pandemic; perception; personal experience; questionnaire; surgeon; telehealth; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; middle aged; orthopedic surgery; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedic Procedures; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires"

This study aimed to investigate what technology O&M professionals in Australia and Malaysia have, use, like, and want to support their client work, to inform the development of O&M technologies and build capacity in the international O&M profession. Materials and Methods: A technology survey was completed by professionals (n = 36) attending O&M workshops in Malaysia. A revised survey was completed online by O&M specialists (n = 31) primarily in Australia. Qualitative data about technology use came from conferences, workshops and interviews with O&M professionals. Descriptive statistics were analysed together with free-text data. Results: Limited awareness of apps used by clients, unaffordability of devices, and inadequate technology training discouraged many O&M professionals from employing existing technologies in client programmes or for broader professional purposes. Professionals needed to learn smartphone accessibility features and travel-related apps, and ways to use technology during O&M client programmes, initial professional training, ongoing professional development and research. Conclusions: Smartphones are now integral to travel with low vision or blindness and early-adopter O&M clients are the travel tech-experts. O&M professionals need better initial training and then regular upskilling in mainstream O&M technologies to expand clients’ travel choices. COVID-19 has created an imperative for technology laggards to upskill for O&M tele-practice. O&M technology could support comprehensive O&M specialist training and practice in Malaysia, to better serve O&M clients with complex needs.Implications for rehabilitation Most orientation and mobility (O&M) clients are travelling with a smartphone, so O&M specialists need to be abreast of mainstream technologies, accessibility features and apps used by clients for orientation, mobility, visual efficiency and social engagement. O&M specialists who are technology laggards need human-guided support to develop confidence in using travel technologies, and O&M clients are the experts. COVID-19 has created an imperative to learn skills for O&M tele-practice. Affordability is a significant barrier to O&M professionals and clients accessing specialist travel technologies in Malaysia, and to O&M professionals upgrading technology in Australia.

The purpose of this study is to be part of such effort by empirically examining the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations that drive people's attitudes to engage in fundraising campaigns launched in many communities, providing a richer understanding of donors' responses. Design/methodology/approach: The present work follows a quantitative approach based on an online survey conducted among potential Kuwaiti charitable donors. A total of 565 useable responses (356 females, 209 males) were obtained using snowball sampling and analyzed through smart partial least squares (SmartPLS) software. Findings: With 90% of respondents financially able to donate who have a monthly income equal to or greater than the average (US$2000), this study confirms the suitability of the model used in predicting donors' attitudes to contribute online to grassroots fundraising campaigns. It reveals that all constructs included in the model (i.e. charitable projects geared for those affected by the pandemic, Internet technology (IT) features and religiosity level) are statistically significant, except for trust in charities. Practical implications: This study suggests that in uncertainty and concern surrounding COVID-19, nonprofit organizations, charities and governments should make concerted efforts toward mitigating the impacts of the pandemic on families and workers who are on the frontline against its outbreak. Possible areas need to be improved through suitable proactive strategies to solicit online monetary donations, such as charitable projects with inclusive information, focus attention on IT features (e.g. privacy, trustworthiness, security and effectiveness) and strengthen the religious faith of donors toward the significance of helping vulnerable groups and regions. Originality/value: The research adds value to the literature on donation and giving behavior by offering an in-depth understanding of what influences online donation attitudes, especially amid such an unprecedented epidemic crisis. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitude; COVID-19; Online monetary donation; Social policy; Vulnerable population",

Differently from players, no health and physical fitness maintenance guidelines were published for match officials. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to guide a safe and successful return to play for match officials. Research methods: Before the return to structured conditioning and officiating, match officials must perform a medical assessment, as well as systematic COVID-19 testing and detailed pulmonary function evaluation. The hygienic-sanitary prevention strategies for virus transmission must be strictly followed. Results and findings: In the remaining part of the present season, alterations of the game rules, namely halves of 30-40 min and no allowance for lost time, aiming to reduce the match officials physiological load may result as a safer option. Nonetheless, match officials' cognitive and physical demands, will probably be exacerbated by the increased number of substitutions per game, proposed to reduce players' match load.

A translation and validation of the FCV-19S in the Malay language was expedited due to the severe psychological sequelae of COVID-19 in Malaysia. Formal WHO forward and backward translation sequences were employed in translating the English version into Malay. Malaysian university participants were recruited via convenience sampling online using snowball methods. The reliability and validity properties of the Malay FCV-19S were rigorously psychometrically evaluated (utilising both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis) in relation to socio-demographic variables and response to the depression, anxiety and stress subscales of the Malay validation of the DASS-21. The sample comprised 228 Malaysian participants. The Cronbach α value for the Malay FCV-19S was 0.893 indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the uni-dimensional factor structure of the FCV19S fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S-M was significantly correlated with anxiety (r = 0.481, p < 0.001) and stress (r = 0.389, p < 0.001) subscales of DASS-21. The FCV-19S-M’s properties tested using Rasch analysis were also satisfactory. Hence, the Malay FCV-19S is valid and reliable, with robust psychometric properties from classical and modern psychometric methods. It therefore is a highly crucial and timely addition to the psychological toolkit both in operational and research settings in identifying, managing and responding to the psychological distress engendered by COVID-19. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; COVID-19 fear; FCV-19S Malay; Fear of COVID-19 scale; Malaysia",

At present, Ayurvedic clinicians do not have access to COVID-19 patients in clinical settings. In these circumstances, a preliminary clinical profiling of COVID-19 based on review of modern medical and classical Ayurvedic literature with inputs from Allopathic clinicians treating COVID-19 patients assumes significance. Objectives: This paper aims to develop an Ayurvedic clinical profile of COVID-19 by literature review supported by analysis of clinical data of a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: The typical clinical presentation of COVID-19 was categorized based on a cluster of symptoms with reference to “Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with confirmed corona virus disease (COVID-19)” released by the US CDC. As the clinical presentation is found to vary widely, research papers reporting clinical symptoms of patient samples from different parts of the world were also reviewed to identify outliers and atypical presentations. Case records of fourteen COVID-19 patients treated at Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon were analyzed to compare symptomatology with data obtained from published literature. Further, a careful correlation was done with the data collected from selected Ayurvedic classical texts and expert views of clinical practitioners to arrive at a preliminary Ayurvedic clinical profile of COVID-19. Results: COVID-19 can be understood from the Ayurvedic perspective as vātakapha dominant sannipātajvara of āgantu origin with pittānubandha. The asymptomatic, presymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critical stages of COVID-19 with varying clinical presentations have been analysed on the basis of nidāna, doṣa, dūṣya, nidānapañcaka and ṣaṭkriyākāla to present a preliminary clinical profile of the disease. Conclusion: In this paper, we have demonstrated that a preliminary clinical profiling of COVID-19 from the Ayurvedic perspective is possible through literature review supported by discussions with Allopathic clinicians as well as examination of patient case records. The provisional diagnosis proposed can be further developed with continued review of literature, wider cooperation and teamwork with Allopathic physicians and access to clinical data as well as direct clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients. © 2020 The Authors","Ayurveda; Clinical profile; COVID-19; Integrative protocol; Pathogenesis",

Some of these lecturers are clinicians who need to juggle between clinical work and teaching, and consider a two-week adaptation during this period to be not enough. Furthermore, converting traditional face-to-face learning to online formats for undergraduate and postgraduate clinical programmes would reduce the learning outcomes, especially those related to clinical applications and the acquisition of new skills.

This disease began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and is widely spread now all over the world. Progressively, Malaysia has been the leading country in Southeast Asia for this outbreak with cases more than 2000 as on 26th March 2020. This article highlights the analysis of the outbreak pattern which follows the exponential growth regression line. Data is collected daily for 66 days starting from the 1st case defined on 25th January 2020. Regression line is used because it can describe the relationship between predictors and the outcome within the datasets that can be used for prediction purposes. Fitting the real data to the graph, an equation which follows the exponential growth model is obtained. The calculation of the relative error between the exact and the approximate data shows that the pattern follows the exponential growth model as it is compared with the quadratic regression line. This analysis can be particularly beneficial for the health authorities in preparing immediate and effective strategies to flatten the curve.

Considering the need for lockdown measures, most countries, including Malaysia, have implemented ‘Movement Control Orders’ (MCOs) as a prevention step to reduce the deadly spread of this disease. Local and worldwide media have reported the immediate improvement of air quality due to this event. Nevertheless, data on the effects of MCOs on air quality at local scales are still sparse. Here, we investigate changes in air quality during the MCO at an urban area using the air sensor network AiRBOXSense which measures monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). In this study, air pollutant data during normal days were compared with MCO days using a reference analyser and AiRBOXSense. The results showed that the levels of the measured pollutants dropped by ~20 to 60% during the MCO days at most locations. However, CO in Kota Damansara (KD) dropped to 48.7%, but PM2.5 and PM10 increased up to 60% and 9.7% respectively during MCO days. Local burning activities in the residential area of KD are believed to be the main cause of the increased PM levels. This study has proven that air pollutant levels have significantly fallen due to the MCO. This air quality level information showed that the reduction of air pollutants can be achieved if traffic and industry emissions are strictly controlled. © The Author(s).","Carbon monoxide; Movement control order; Particulate matters","Air quality; Disease control; Sensor networks; Air pollutants; Air quality levels; Burning activity; Industry emissions; Local scale; Movement control; Particulate Matter; Residential areas; Quality control; air quality; disease spread; particulate matter; urban area; urban pollution; virus; Klang Valley; Malaysia; West Malaysia"

Recent evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits neurotropic properties and causes neurological diseases. Here, we review the literature on neurological involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infections and the possible mechanisms of invasion of the nervous system by this virus, to provide a summary and critical analysis of the early reporting of neurological involvement in COVID-19. An exhaustive search of scientific articles on neurological involvement in COVID-19 was performed in the Web of Science, Scopus, Medline/PubMed, and several other databases. Nineteen relevant articles that had been published or were in preprint were carefully selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on our research, we found that patients with COVID-19 can present with neurological symptoms that can be broadly divided into central nervous system involvement, such as headache, dizziness, altered mental state, and disorientation, and peripheral nervous system involvement, such as anosmia and hypogeusia. Most of these patients are in the older age group and exhibit comorbidities, especially hypertension, and severe infection. In extreme presentations of COVID-19, some patients exhibit seizures, stroke, flaccid paraparesis, corticospinal weakness, and even coma. Moreover, the neurological manifestations can occur independently of the respiratory system. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause multiple neurological syndromes in a more complex presentation. Therefore, this review elucidated the involvement of the nervous system in SARS-CoV-2 infection and will hopefully help improve the management of COVID-19. ©The Author(s) (2020).","Central nervous system; CNS; Coronavirus; Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; Nervous system; Pandemic; Peripheral nervous system; PNS; SARS-CoV-2; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; human; neurologic disease; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral"

The method used to characterize the sensor is by comparing sensor output voltages with the value of water turbidity. Turbid water used was created by adding distilled water with a concentration of sediment obtained from the filtered sediment with less than 60 μm in diameter. Data transmission performance for various transmit power was done by calculating the error percentages by comparing the number of messages sent by transmitter and received by re-ceiver. The transmit power settings were 0, -6, -12, and 18 dBm and variations in the distance of data transmission from 10 to 80 m. The test results show that the water turbidity sensor has a good measurement range in measuring turbidity of water from 1.873 to 3500 NTU. Higher concentrations of sediment and turbidity of the water made the sensor output voltage decrease. There was a decrease in output voltage in the value, namely -0.0006 in turbidity sensor sensitivity. The results also show an increase in error percentages as the dis-tance of data transmission increases, while the bigger the transmit power is used for data transmission, the smaller the percentage of errors occurs. © 2020 Tim Pengembang Jurnal UPI.","Arduino; Covid-19 pandemic; Receiver; Telemetry; Transmitter; Water turbidity",

Teaching/university hospitals should pull their resources and man-power to provide the muchneeded assistance to the demand of Covid-19 testing. Inadequate testing could result in unrecognised Covid-19 infected individuals, roaming freely in the population. The other issue is the sensitivity of test if samples were obtained from different sites. Classically, the confirmation of diagnosis of Covid-19 depends on real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to detect viral genetic material in either a nasal swab or bronchioalveolar lavage sample. Wang et al. (2020) reported that bronchioalveolar lavage sample has the highest sensitivity in identifying Covid-19, followed by sputum and nasal swab with positive rates of 93%, 72% and 63%, respectively.3 Furthermore, they found that nasal swab contained the highest concentration of viral load as it required less number of cycles to achieve higher copy numbers. In some patients, viral genetic material was also identified in faeces and blood.3 While the reliability of testing is a concern, the safety of the laboratory staff also has to be kept in mind.

This research aims to determine the students’ sources of information regarding the COVID-19 disease and investigate their intention to share the information pertaining to COVID-19. A survey study was designed using an online questionnaire involving 147 higher education students. The online questionnaire; measures three elements of the students’ intention, namely initiative, desire and resourcefulness. The findings; the sources of information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic are mainly the government authorities and local healthcare workers. The most preferred medium of information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is social media, and the most trusted medium is the television broadcast. Also, finding suggests that the students take initiative to verify information and demonstrate a desire to share credible and right information with their family and friends through social media. As such, in an effort or attempt to disseminate credible information about any important matters to the general public, the government can count on students as agents for transmitting the information to third parties including their family and friends. © 2020 Tim Pengembang Jurnal UPI. © 2020, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia.

There are problems of distribution of drugs and kits of test equipment to areas far from large cities in the center of the corona pandemic due to access difficulty. Remote locations, being difficult to reach, make the distribution of drugs and equipment for rapid test-ing uneven so that the recovery rate of patients in the area has a low percentage. Meanwhile, it is essential to ensure the availability of drugs and rapid test equipment in every public health center in all directions of Indonesia.

Methods: Twelve relevant manuscripts were sourced from a total of 7288 search results obtained using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar. The search keywords used were COVID-19, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, swabs, SARS and CoV2. Original manuscripts were obtained and analysed by all authors. The review included manuscripts which have not undergone rigorous peer-review process in view of the magnitude of the topic discussed. Results: The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract was significantly higher during the first week and peaked at 4-6 days after onset of symptoms, during which it can be potentially sampled. Nasopharyngeal swab has demonstrated higher viral load than oropharyngeal swab, where the difference in paired samples is best seen at 0-9 days after the onset of illness. Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab was higher than oropharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 patients. Patient self-collected throat washing has been shown to contain higher viral load than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, with significantly higher sensitivity when compared with paired nasopharyngeal swab. Recommendations: Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID-19 infection should take anatomy of the nasal cavity into consideration to increase patient comfort and diagnostic yield. Routine oropharyngeal swab should be replaced by throat washing which has demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy, and it is safe towards others. © 2020, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family Coronaviridae and genus Betacoronavirus. Betacoronaviruses are only reported to infect mammals. Currently there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect aquatic food animals (e.g. finfish, crustaceans, molluscs, amphibians) and therefore these animals do not play an epidemiological role in spreading COVID-19 to humans. Aquatic food animals and their products, like any other surface, may potentially become contaminated with SARS-CoV-2, especially when handled by people who are infected with the virus. Nevertheless, with proper food handling and sanitation, the likelihood of contamination of aquatic animals or their products with SARS-CoV-2 should be negligible. The COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect livelihoods, food security and nutrition for populations that rely on aquatic animals as a source of food or income. On a positive side, however, COVID-19 outbreaks may lead to an increase in local community utilization of aquatic food animals or their products due to limited transportation or limited supplies of alternative sources of animal proteins. © Asian Fisheries Society.","Aquatic food animals; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Fish; Public health; SARS-CoV-2",

Diagnosis of suspected cases is confirmed by nucleic acid assays with real-time PCR, using respiratory samples. Serology tests are comparatively easier to perform, but their utility may be limited by the performance and the fact that antibodies appear later during the disease course. We aimed to describe the performance data on serological assays for COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A review of multiple reports and kit inserts on the diagnostic performance of rapid tests from various manufacturers that are commercially available were performed. Only preliminary data are available currently. Results: From a total of nine rapid detection test (RDT) kits, three kits offer total antibody detection, while six kits offer combination SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in two separate test lines. All kits are based on colloidal gold-labeled immunochromatography principle and one-step method with results obtained within 15 minutes, using whole blood, serum or plasma samples. The sensitivity for both IgM and IgG tests ranges between 72.7% and 100%, while specificity ranges between 98.7% to 100%. Two immunochromatography using nasopharyngeal or throat swab for detection of COVID-19 specific antigen are also reviewed. Conclusions: There is much to determine regarding the value of serological testing in COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. More comprehensive evaluations of their performance are rapidly underway. The use of serology methods requires appropriate interpretations of the results and understanding the strengths and limitations of such tests. © 2020, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

Since then pathogenic human coronaviruses were identified beginning with the discovery of SARS-CoV in 2002. With the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2, there are now seven human coronaviruses. Those that cause mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic species are SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are spherical (125nm diameter), and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface giving the appearance of a solar corona. Within the helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is the large positive sense, single stranded RNA. Of the four coronavirus genera (a,b,g,d), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are classified under a-CoV (HCoV-229E and NL63) and b-CoV (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1). SARS-CoV-2 is a b-CoV and shows fairly close relatedness with two bat-derived CoV-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Even so, its genome is similar to that of the typical CoVs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, and it appears to be so for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The possibility of an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans has already been shown with civet cats acting as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoVs, and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV. Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact of respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. The coronaviral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, all of which are encoded within the 3’ end of the genome. The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors resulting in fusion and subsequent viral entry. The M protein is the most abundant protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. The E protein is the smallest of the major structural proteins and participates in viral assembly and budding. The N protein is the only one that binds to the RNA genome and is also involved in viral assembly and budding. Replication of coronaviruses begin with attachment and entry. Attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S protein and its specific receptor. Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes. Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs resulting in the formation of the mature virus. Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis. © 2020, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.
